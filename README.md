# BookReviewClassification
Classification based on whether or not the review's author finished the book
First, I'll admit that:
  - the code could be more succint
  - I'm sure I could make use of some more tools in scikit learn and/or nltk for preprocessing/feature engineering.
    - A much needed development I'm working on soon ^.^
 
 I'm aiming to combine ML model outputs with the presence of certain keywords/phrases/speech patterns common to book reviews where the consumer hasn't finished the book. Such an application may be useful for either ranking the "credibility" of reviews (eg a review indicates that they have only read the first chapter => lower credibility), or for detecting poor-quality books, as many consumers stop reading beacuse they dislike the book.

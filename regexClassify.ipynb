      " it is fairly long although it keeps a good pace if i missed anything it was perhaps more psychological insight and if we stop to think about it the police force seems pretty ineffective but",
      " the story is told in chapters written in the third person from different points of view mostly porters the lead investigator in the case although not fully back to work after some time off we learn the reason later in the book and emorys the young victim although there is the odd chapter from one of the other detectives points of view clair interspersed with this we have fragments of the killers diary which is found in the pocket of a man killed by a bus at the beginning of the book the diary that starts out pretty harmless as the account of what seems to be a pretty normal childhood gets creepier and creepier as it goes along and it provides an understanding or justification of sorts for the killers later behaviour blood is thicker and all that but there are also lies secrets and betrayals that is if we are to believe the diary  that and other aspects of the book and i dont want to say much to avoid spoilers including the catandmouse chase provide us with some interesting insights into the mind of the killer and emphasise the fact that appearances can be very deceptive a seemingly normal middleclass family can hide all kinds of dirty secrets and upperclass families can too as becomes evident through the book the revengeavenging aspect of the murders the sins of the fathers are visited",
      " is not new although it makes the murderer more intriguing the other parts of the book help move the story forward and the events are set chronologically from the moment porter is awakened by a phone call that brings him back to the police as hes been chasing the 4mk killer for over five years although porters point of view dominates the novel i did not feel we got to know him all that well yes something has happened to him i guessed what it was early on and he is suffering and unwilling to openly acknowledge that or discuss it he is not keen on gadgets and seems utterly out of touch with new technologies and social media and he is determined and driven putting himself at risk repeatedly for the good of others but although i liked the fact that the team of detectives investigating the case were pretty normal individuals not corrupt not twisted and bitter even when it would be more than justified not morally ambiguous psychopaths i still missed having more of a sense of who porter really is clair has little page space and i got no sense of her own personality other than knowing that she cares for porter and her colleagues and she has an amusing lovedislike relationship with nash who is the character that provides the light relief throughout the book in the case of emory who finds herself in a terrifying situation we get to share her experiences with her and it is one of the most effective portions of the book adding to the tension and the need to keep turning the pages the style of writing is direct with only the necessary descriptions to allow us to follow the investigation including descriptions of clues and places i particularly enjoyed the idea of the tunnels from bootlegging times that help bring the settings history into the novel the chronological storyline and the signposting of the different points of view make it a story dynamic and easy to read and although it is perhaps longer than the norm in the genre it is a fairly quick read as i said there are plenty of twists and turns enough to keep ones mind busy although i suspect avid readers of the genre will guess a few of them if not all i have read some of the comments disparaging the fact that the police seem to be pretty ineffective and they only get to rescue the victim thanks to the clues left by the killer indeed that is so in fairness porter who seems the most cluedon of the team and the expert on this case is battling personal issues of his own and not at his best but if anything that further emphasises the relationship between porter and the killer what attracts the killer to porter the ending oh yes very satisfying although of course it creates intrigue for the next book in the series highlights that issue even more i get the feeling that this series will improve as it goes along but only time will tell in summary a story of evil hiding in unexpected places of secrets and lies that are covered by a thin veneer of normality and a solid police procedural thriller with a main character and a killer whose relationship holds the key to more mysteries to come  ah a word of warning if you dont like graphic violence and torture you might want to give it a miss\n",

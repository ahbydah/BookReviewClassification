(never understood the point of hardcore evangelical atheism to start with. however, when you're trying to get people to pay you for something, it's probably best to keep your freaky religious natterings to yourself if they have nothing to do with the plot.) never the less, i slogged on, and wasted another hour of my life on a book that never got any better. don't make the same mistake. avoid, avoid, avoid.\n",

(this is where a good editor could've made a difference. i kept thinking i'd already read something, and in fact, the same statements were made throughout the book) i've never been to alaska, but i had no sense of its beauty and majesty; instead, i read that the characters loved it, and met a cast of characters who surely must be extreme stereotypes of people who seek a free life in remote areas. i have less than 15 pages to go...and i really don't care what happens to anyone, since they are not believable. disappointed. waste of money.\n",

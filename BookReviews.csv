c,"What do I think? I honestly don't know. My favorite poems were Elm, The Moon and the Yew Tree, and Edge. I admit that Sylvia Plath's poetry may be beyond my ability to fullly understand. I have The Collected Poems, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1982, on my to-read shelf. Maybe the more I read the better I will understand. There is an aura about Sylvia Plath that I find fascinating. Her writing is so unique, so different from anything else, you can't help being drawn to it, like a moth to a flame.",,,,,,
c,"This was a long, sad tale; full of tragedy. It was much longer than it needed to be and so predictable. It was endlessly depressing.",,,,,,

c,"This book is remarkable. That should be enough but this is a work that should not be shortchanged. Kristin Hannah had created a work that will resonate forcefully and painfully for anyone who has experienced the dynamics of having a family member suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of having seen firsthand the atrocities of war. The author has captured feelings that must be felt personally before they can be presented in such a relatable manner. The hurt and the pain and the quality of life destroying actions of the person suffering from PTSD is conveyed in such a manner by the author that the sensitivities of the reader makes him/her scream ""Make it stop!!!!!!!"" . In real life the hurt emanating from PTSD transcends generations. My own father was discharged from the Army in 1946 and my family lived off of his Veterans' Administration Disability check for the next fifty years. In 1946 PTSD was referred to as ""she'll shocked"". My dad was largely a non-functioning human being as a result of the tranquilizers and anti-depressants prescribed by the VA. I would hope that progress has been made in the treatment of PTSD, but after reading this novel, I have my doubts. The greatest benefit that I derived from reading this novel is the fact that at age 70 i can finally say ""There is at least one person who understands."" . Perhaps now the rest of the world will have a better handle on the sacrifices being made by the members of our armed forces and their families.",,,,,,
i,I can't wait to read this book and give my life some form of purpose again,,,,,,
c,"I loved Ms. Ng's prior novel, and this one was as strong if not stronger. It's very readable -- she's an excellent writer -- and she creates fascinating and intricate characters. Also notable is her ability to create suspense through a strong set of related plot lines, without sacrificing character development. In fact, I'd define this largely as a character and theme-driven novel, with the plot secondary to the rich interior lives and interrelationships among her main characters. Throughout the novel, we seesaw between parallel themes relating to pregnancy, birth and motherhood; the drive to reproduce and nurture; the desire for order and the status quo vs. an openness to change and embracing of creativity; sexual desire and love. These themes take shape in every interaction between the characters and Ms. Ng's talent also shows in how real they all seem -- both the adults and the teenagers, the females and the male. For me, Mia Warren was the beating heart of the novel, a genuinely fascinating individual and internally consistent. But at the same time, she also seemed almost too ""perfect"" a character -- morally incorruptible, true only to her art (sometimes to her daughter's detriment), wise beyond her years, yet in some ways incredibly selfish and self-indigent, following her internal muse to a degree not possible for most ""mere mortals."" So at the end, with the Richardson's difficult daughter on her own in the world, taking inspiration from Mia, do we applaud her courage or fear for her future?",,,,,,
c,"Dark, depressing.... sad! I’ve only read one other Kristen Hannah novel, so I’m not an expert on her writing, but this one was difficult for me to get through because of the abuse.",,,,,,
c,"Having been severely disappointed with Nesbo's eagerly-awaited Macbeth a few days ago, I approached this fantasy retelling of King Lear with some trepidation - but, you know what, it's wonderful! Gratton shows her deep understanding of the original in so many ways even while she contests and subverts it. Rather than this being a Lear via Game of Thrones, it serves to reveal how much GoT is already indebted to Lear (and others). The writing is gorgeous: lyrical and poetic in its evocation of a world ordered by earth and water magic; dark and edgy when it comes to close-up encounters between, especially, couples: Regan and Connley (Cornwall), Gaela and Astore (Goneril and Albany). This cleverly unpicks all those problems that have challenged students and scholars: the missing mothers, for example, are written back in; and the three daughters of Lear are no longer conventional fairy-tale archetypes of good and bad women, but have characters of their own - bound by a love which supersedes their differences. There are solid reasons, too, for the division between the Goneril character and her husband, and for the Edmund character (Ban) to develop the way he does. Big moments from the play like Gloucester's eyes are handled adroitly, making their presence felt but in keeping with their new setting. Less successful are the constant flashbacks: the book insists on giving us backstories to relationships which are already fully-fleshed in the present. Cutting these would have tautened up the pace as this feels unnecessarily drawn out in places. Some character additions, too, could have gone: Aefa, the Fool's daughter, does little other than add to the plethora of female characters displacing the male ones of Shakespeare. Nevertheless, this is a hugely enjoyable read and an impressive re-imagining of Lear.",,,,,,
c,"I can't imagine how difficult it is for a writer, even one who has been publishing successfully for some years now as Kristin Hannah has, to push through the pressure of expectation to write a novel following a breakout smash hit like The Nightingale. The Great Alone strikes me as a very different kind of novel than The Nightingale, but I think readers will appreciate it every bit as much. In this new novel, Hannah examines the strangely compelling and horrifyingly brutal world of a teenage girl, Leni, who is trapped inside her father's wanderlust and her parents's dysfunctional marriage. The climate of Leni's existence, her parents's suffocating love and codependency, coupled with the madness of abuse is hard to witness, but never shied away from or oversimplified. Hannah manages to give readers an unflinching yet almost sympathetic glimpse of this fraught subject matter, all the while giving three dimensionality to all her wonderful, eclectic supporting characters. Both The Nightingale and The Great Alone explore the repercussions of war, its brutality and the utter devastation wartime captivity leaves on soldiers. The Nightingale, in which WWII stains and heightens every moment, is set primarily in wartime. The Great Alone is similarly a war novel, in that Leni's father was a soldier and POW in Vietnam, and the family moves to Alaska at the outset of the novel because of a wartime legacy, but the novel is set post-war. Nevertheless, the scars of Vietnam are deep and lasting; as the novel reveals, the titular ""great alone"" encompasses the interior, mental landscape as well as the more obvious external, physical, challenging world of off the grid Alaska. The novel spans the time between 1974 and 1986. At times, Alaska's suffocating unrelieved winter darkness closes in on Leni and her hopes and dreams. The contrasting, unremitting daylight of the Alaskan summer means not joy and ease, but endless hard work in anticipation of the winter to come. And yet this book gives its readers the buoyancy of hope: it looks like love, love and patience and perseverance that is bigger than anger and damage and time.",,,,,,
c,"Ernest Cline's novel is not post apocalypse, but sort of post slide-into-serious-dysfunction. The only bright spot in many peoples' lives is an on-line experience called ""OASIS."" A young man, who has a very grim ""real life,"" finds solace and a few friends in OASIS. The book has lots of adventure, good dialog, and a reasonable moral compass. Cline's writing is smooth and enjoyable. My main quibble with the book is the amount of narration. This slowed the pace for me -- especially in the first part of the book where the main character is basically ""telling"" the reader the backstory for the novel. Once that was out of the way, the pace picked up and the story pulled me in.",,,,,,
c,"The story, while somewhat interesting at times, fell flat when it came to the secrets behind Gramps' unusual life. Did I miss something, or did the author never give us any closure to what was going on with him? For me, the mystery was the most interesting part of the story, but alas, the secrets were never revealed.",,,,,,
c,"I did not like this book. I'm a little gobsmacked by the adulation it gets because it's a bad teen novel wrapped in a morass of 80s nostalgia. I checked it out of the library when it got all these terrific reviews from wired.com and the like and put it down about 50 pages in. Being bored this weekend, I started it again on Friday eve and finished it off tonight and feel like I read what I imagine a novel written by Michael Bay and edited by Roland Emerich would be. It's simply that bad. I struggle to consider it science fiction. It's like the novelisation of a low budget SyFy mini-series funded by a ridiculous amount of product placements.",,,,,,
c,"I read the entire book but was sorry I did. Mia was made to be a hero, but I have no idea why. She was as lost and confused as Mrs. Richardson . Not only were the characters unrealistic the same could be said for the storyline.",,,,,,
c,"Although the writing is good, the story and some of the characters are tortuous, maddening and depressing until just before the very end. It ends on hope, but there is far too little of that throughout too much of the book for my taste. So many times I almost put it down. I don’t know why I pushed through until the end... I’m glad I did though... and I’m also glad that it’s over!!",,,,,,
c,"This wasn't that good. I went in fully expecting this book to be right up my alley. Blue is the Warmest Color made me cry for 3 days straight. I've lived in a dorm alone. I fully expected this to be a great after a string of mediocre books and just found nothing. There's nothing inherently wrong with the story except that it's painfully short and half baked. This couldn't be much more than 30,000 words which is less than half the size of a an average novel. While the grief and loneliness is adequately developed, every single aspect of Marin's life is underdeveloped. I just couldn't find myself caring. The twists weren't that interesting, the revelation that she didn't need Mabel as a romantic partner was the only good thing about the marrative. I don't know if this was supposed to be young adult fiction, I didn't see it indicated anywhere on the book or amazon page, just hundreds of glowing reviews for a very average book. I'm sure the countless rave reviews damaged my expectations for this book, but it was still short and boring. I also feel if this wasn't about a lesbian relationship it would have been unfinishable.The chapters and book are short making it easy to page through but I feel if this was a full length book I wouldn't have maintained interest until the end.",,,,,,
i,"WTF is this thing doing in a Bestseller List? At best, it’s YA ala Judy Blume. I’m listening to it so at least I’m not expending any extra energy but unless the last ten chapters are spectacular- and really - nothing is saving this wasted effort - it will be $15 very poorly spent.",,,,,,
c,"This was a tremendous book. It carried a variety of themes but the one that was most striking to me was the problem of abuse. It also touches on how broken people become as a result of warfare. The dominant theme is how dependent and helpless a women is and how that forces her to stays connected to an abusive husband. The book pursues this point relentlessly with the reader wondering why this women would continue to allow herself to be abused in this way. It also brings her to the point where she can take it no more and brings it to a close rather dramaticlly. A somewhat minor theme the book illustrates how people get caught in the system and how having contacts with influence can thwart the system. With the book being set in Alaska, it gives it a rather interesting persona. Great Alone in my opinion is a highly recomended read",,,,,,
c,"I would have given this book 5 stars after reading the first third of the book but got bogged down on Mia’s section. Too much detail about her past, chapters were so long, & there were several. I just wanted to get on with the main story. Also, the custody issue. As a social worker the judge does look at what is in the best interest of the child. But the birth mother & father, they have a timeframe to make every possible effort to find them. A person doesn’t just drop her baby at a fire house & a fireman who works there & his wife adopt the baby. There are legal issues here, but as I always say, it’s only a book. Characters are well developed, the only unlikable character was Elena, very mean spirited. Pearl had a connection with all 4 kids. Book certainly had shadings of the Stepford Wives. Will I read this author’s other book. Probably.
",,,,,,
c,"Very underwhelmed by this novel. Amazon chose it as one of the best novels of 2017 and it received many rave reviews. I was extremely disappointed by every aspect of this novel. At best, it reads like a book for middle schoolers which attempts, unsuccessfully, to raise points about societal ills. Very predictable, superficial and, for the most part, a big yawn. Kept with it to the dreary, uninspiring end. No part of this book was worth the time. I will not read this author again.",,,,,,
c,"This book was very good but very sad. I enjoyed it despite the sadness because the characters were very interesting. She does a good job of exploring grief and taking you through the feelings after you lose somebody. Marin was very broken and she felt very lonely and it made her perspective interesting. I enjoyed also reading about her relationship with Mabel, everyone needs a friend through it all. Marin should not have run out on her life but I understand the reasoning in it. Now the thing I didn't like was the gramps story line. Losing a love one is hard. It destroys families, it breaks your heart, it can literally change a person. Sometimes people just don't survive the change after a death. Now taking it and turning into into a big twist for plot was gross. I didn't enjoy that. Over all though I liked the book.",,,,,,
i,Uhh wow yes this was amazing. Full review to come!,,,,,,
c,"I wish I could get my time and money back after reading this novel. It reads like a YA novel, full of unbelievable superficial characters, mostly teenagers, and repetitive descriptions of this supposed idyllic town of Shaker. Poorly developed plot and the writing is just writing, not creative or inspiring at all, with a predictable ending. Spoiler in the first chapter...teen daughter gets angry and burns the family home to the ground and runs away.",,,,,,
c,The book was just okay for me. The visuals of the setting are nice but the plot is quite boring. Recommend others to read it but I felt the book was jus okay.,,,,,,
i,"This looks so good! So happy I got approved for an ARC! I'm going to dive into it first thing tonight. :) Review to come soon. Thank you Netgalley, and Tor for approving me for an Advanced Review Copy!",,,,,,
c,"I wanted to love this book enough to give it more than 3 stars, but I found myself exasperated by the endless chapters that were seemingly written more so for young adults. The 3 stars are for creativity with regard to telling the audience early on what the main events would be - a fire that sets a home ablaze, and a controversial adoption - which kept me curious enough to finish the book. However, I would have wished she cut through some of the cheesy YA portions of the book (e.g., high schoolers and their hormones) and dig deeper into a couple of the characters to give them more substance rather than just fleeting ideas in the background. Not sure whether I’d be reading her other books, and not sure why people have given her book such high ratings.",,,,,,
c,I kept waiting for something interesting to happen but was disappointed. I could only get through a few pages at a time.,,,,,,
c,Pretty good. Takes a look at grief and how we deal with it in order to heal and move on. I really enjoyed it but it was lacking something that I can't quite put my finger on. It might be that I'm not super interested in books that's aren't plot based. The writing was really beautiful in my opinion and if I'm totally honest I bought this book because of the cover.,,,,,,
c,"Half the fun when you’re reading crime is figuring out who the killer is, so it’s unfortunate when said killer gets squished by a bus in the first few minutes of a book. In this case it’s all about finding his last victim. A one-eared teen hidden in a cement jungle in a dark room full of nasty surprises.The killer picks his victims in an odd way. He chooses to inflict secondary pain by killing someone close to the person he wants to punish. Of course that pain is nothing compared to the butcher-like torture he expresses upon his physical victims. Bit by bit and parcel by parcel. A cat and mouse game ensues with Detective Porter, who is dealing with plenty of personal issues at the time FMK returns to make a last stand. There are plenty of twist and turns combined with strong characters and a compelling plot. Barker likes to take his readers to very dark places, literally dark places. I will not tell a lie, the author manages to create the type of images that make your spine tingle and the hairs rise up on the back of your neck. It’s creepy and vicious, in a very IT clown staring up at you from a drain, kind of way. Barker writes a wicked plot, a wee bit gruesome and barbaric at times, but definitely a fast-paced and blood fuelled exhilarating read. Definitely an author I will be revisiting. *I received an ARC of this book courtesy of the publisher via NetGalley.*",,,,,,
c,"This book doesn't have much character development, doesn't really teach what I think it is trying to, and mostly seems like a way for the author to beat off to their love and knowledge of the 80s. I mean, it was my favorite decade, but the fact that none other are referenced in this story taking place in the far future is disappointing. The writing is alright, and I think it will be better on the silver screen. Spielberg will make it pretty, and entertaining. This book is alsonot much intothe genre of mmorpg fiction, but touching on it like paranormal touches on paranormal romance.",,,,,,
i,Don't throw many books away....but this one went in the trash...so depressing I gave up...that's not why I read!!!!,,,,,,
c,"The story actually starts out in an interesting way - the MC is staying in a dorm all by herself over the winter break and has all the plans of keeping herself busy - learning meditation, reading, coking, etc. I would totally read a YA novel about staying secluded FOR PLEASURE and enjoying the bliss of disconnecting and being alone for awhile. But alas, We Are Okay is not a book about that, it appears to be about the things well covered by it must be hundreds of YA books about grief and loss. Even though the novel is well written, I am not interested.",,,,,,
i,"Slightly disappointing, 3.5 stars. Buddy read with GR's #1 user. This looks very promising, now me thinks future me will be happy that now me decided to pick this :)",,,,,,
c,"This is one of the most disappointing pieces of Science Fiction I've ever read. The only thing this book has going for it is nostalgia. Yes, there is a bunch of cool stuff from the 80's stuffed in here. The writing, however, is inexcusably bad. Infodumps abound for lackluster worldbuilding, and the characters range from mediocre, to generic, to offensively stereotypical. The story lacks any dramatic tension until the very end and the romance is about as cookie-cutter as they come. The concept of a hero in a hyper-realistic virtual world is nothing new, and this is not a particularly good rendition of it; in fact it's a particularly bad rendition of it. Avoid this book.",,,,,,
i,"I read the first six chapters, so this is only a partial review.  ""Courage does not always roar. Valor does not always shine."" In the beginning, Orïsha was a land where the rare and sacred maji lived. But when they started to abuse their powers as kings and queens the gods stripped them of their gifts. And the love of the people became hate and they started to wipe the maji from their world. And then magic disappeared. 
In my opinion the story is really interesting and I'm definitely going to read more of it when it is published. Zélie is rebellious, strong and sees injustice and wants to fight it. That makes her a strong female character I want to know more of. 
And the absolute coolest thing is that she raised a lionaire that is now faithful to her. After Amaris best friend is killed by her father she steals the artifact. That's a really courageous and it needs even more strength to betray your family with this. This makes Amari an even more interesting character. Before magic disappeared there were majis who could control water, who commend fire. Some could read minds, peer through time, heal or bring disease. Others could tame wild beasts or wield darkness and light. 
It seems that in this past everything was possible, they were no limits, no rules. It's a really nice writing, that you can read fast without stopping. ",,,,,,
c,"This is a spectacular epic. A love for Alaska shines through the twisting, turning story of a small family who love and hurt each other. We see the horror of war in it's after effects. The glimpse of life in the 1970's. Our heroine is a child who moves so often she never fits in. Her father is left property in Alaska by his army friend who didn't make it back.",,,,,,
c,"When the story moves to Alaska everything comes vividly alive, the scenery, the characters and the story.",,,,,,
c,"It was everything! Beauty, tragedy, love and redemption. Riveting, horrifying and absolutely wonderful. I highly recommend this soon to be classic.",,,,,,
c,Kristin Hannah has outdone herself again in this magnificent saga about a young girl's journey to Alaska and her coming of age. Her descriptions of this vast state and it's beauty pall in comparison to it's brutal characteristics. One of the most meaningful love stories between Matthew and Leni that I have ever read. The human frailty of both her parents and the inner strength of so many that she learns to love in this vast place. I re-dreamed the last chapter all night. Always a good thing. I highly recommend this book. You almost feel a sense of accomplishment when you finally put it down as if you too have survived a long winter and finally seen the sun and smelled summer.,,,,,,
i,reading the first chapter im already in love and went ahead bought two different editions of this book with no regrets :):):),,,,,,
c,"Breathless pacing, masterful worldbuilding, and a heroine we've all been waiting for. This book is beautiful, powerful, and totally badass. You need it in your life.",,,,,,
c,"This was such a nice surprise! I've been meaning to read this book for AGES, and I've built it up in my head as this super dry, boring book, but boy was I ever wrong. This book is juuuust about 200 years old, yet it feels incredibly timeless, more than many other classics I've read. It was so interesting, and the character of Frankenstein's monster was so tragic (and he can speak! I didn't see that coming thanks to Hollywood ruining the image of ""Frankenstein"") that there just wasn't time to be bored! I also listened to the audiobook narrated by Dan Stevens, and he did an amazing job. Highly recommend!",,,,,,
c,"Excellent book. A great study in both the frailty and the strength of human beings and the family bond. At every turn this book illustrates that there is ALWAYS a story behind the story....a reason for why a person acts the way he or she does, the deep fear / heartache / love that drives one's actions which the casual observer could not possibly guess. Or not even the casual observer...sometimes even the people closest to you. These characters were at once profoundly frustrating in their inability to truly HEAR and understand each other, but admirable in their resilience and fierce allegiance to those they love. Ng truly brings her characters to life and in doing so evokes great feeling from the reader (or at least in my case!). I would highly recommend this book.
",,,,,,
c,I didn’t like it. I kept waiting for something to happen. Writer spent soooo much time getting me to know the characters but after awhile I could care less about them. I just wanted the book to end. Why doesn’t amazon give me my money back?,,,,,,
c,Very anti climactic. Very predictable. I thought this book would have a lot more significance. The book was a downer with no purpose.,,,,,,
i,"I read 80 pages of this book and it was so boring.
",,,,,,
c,"I rarely feel compelled to write a review because what we each enjoy reading can be so subjective. However - the glowing reviews for this novel were part of the reason I decide to purchase it and to read it. This novel was so trite, sophomoric and predictable that I actually checked to see if I had mistakenly chosen teen literature. Save your time and your money !!",,,,,,
c,"I loved it! Before reading this book I had heard the story we all know about Frankestein. A suffered no-human being and blah blah blah. However, the story, how is written in general is amazing. The description of Viktor, what he suffered to build that monster, how obsessed he was about that. And then, well, no need to describe how much this poor little creature suffered. One can say ""that life is suffered, but many lives are..."", and it's true, but everything depends on how the story (or life) is told. About the details in the book, I will keep it for myself and I will just share them with someone who wants to talk to me about this book. I don't like to spoil much. I totally recommend it. A MASTERPIECE!",,,,,,

i,"3 stars DNF I read an excerpt, an incredibly long and misleading excerpt that must have been around 200 pages, of this novel. If I had known that I was reading an excerpt and not the full novel I would have DNFed it. However, I will be considering this novel read because I have no desire to pick up the entire novel. I’m massively peeved about this and I feel like I wasted a large chunk of my time reading a novel that I thought was the first in the series and now I know why I felt like I was reading so much exposition. I was wondering why new characters were being introduced 98% into the novel and it’s because my ARC copy was only excerpt. I have a lot of problems with this novel that goes beyond feeling betrayed the publisher and mislead because when I downloaded the copy it did not state that was excerpt until AFTER the publication date did this become a subtitle on my Netgalley dashboard. Moving on, this is a standalone retelling of King Lear by William Shakespeare. I am a massive King Lear fan and I think it is one the easier plays of Shakespeare’s as well as being overall brilliant in concept and themes. I have a great passion for Lear and so when I saw that there was a fantasy retelling coming out for this novel I was excited and intrigued. A Breakdown of the Pros and Cons of this novel: There are talking trees and magical elements that are vastly fascinating. However, if I’m being honest these magical elements did not seem fully expanded upon and they lacked believability within the world created. Gaela, Regan, and Elia sticking close to the original characters, but being heavily expanded upon. I always associated Goneril with gonorrhea and she was easily my most hated character of the original play, but Gaela is much more human and she is a force to be reckoned with. I also greatly dislike her, but I dislike her actions not her character and that is a huge plus. Regan stays true to the original Regan, but she is much more fleshed out. Regan struggles with miscarriages and failed pregnancies and it really makes her devotion to Gaela real and understandable. Whereas in the original play, it just is. Elia does stay true to Cordelia in a sense, but she is easily the most boring of the sisters. I loved Cordelia, but I can barely stand Elia. I think Gratton struggled with this character.",,,,,,
c,"I loved this book . It had everything in it to stimulate interest and emotional feelings of love, hate, admiration, courage, sympathy an emotionsl psychological study of human character. I grew to love and even hate some characters ... all were interesting, intertwining, hateful, loving, courageous, adventuresome, mysterious, sympathetic, accommodating, trying to live harmoniously in the Great Alone ... Alaska. It is a page turner, I cried, I sobbed, I couldn’t put it down for long. I loved every page. It is one of the best novels I have ever read. Kirstin Hannah is a beautiful writer with passion and realistic",,,,,,
c,"The best thing about the original play is the Fool. Gratton stays true to the Fool’s wise, but confounding phrases and it is so enjoyable. My favorite line from King Lear is in the opening scene when Cordelia tells Lear “Nothing, my lord.” When she is asked how much she loves him. I loved the way the scene was done in this retelling. It’s told from the PoV from the Fool’s daughter (who does not exist in the play) and it is done so brilliantly. It was the part of this entire excerpt I read. The problem is that it occurred 50% through the 200 pages I read. The lyrical prose is trying too hard. I love lyrical prose, but I also know that not all writers are able to capture this style with grace and ease. Gratton is one of those authors who struggles. A vast majority of her descriptive language is redundant and pointless. Early on, I considered DNFing because of the style, but I pushed on because I love King Lear and wanted to see how it would end. I didn’t even get a conclusion, so I should’ve just DNFed. I’m mainly disappointed because I don’t know how Gratton approaches Gloucester losing his eyes, the Edmund obsession that all the sisters eventually acquire and the death of everyone. I really just want to know how everything is handled so send me spoilers because I won’t be seeking out this novel to find out. Whimsical Writing Scale: 3 Character Scale: 3.5 Plotastic Scale: 4 Cover Thoughts: It’s so wonderful to see PoC hands on the cover of an adult fantasy novel. Thank you, Netgalley and Tor, for providing me with an excerpt of this novel in exchange for an honest review.",,,,,,
c,"Another beautiful and thought provoking book from Lisa Genova. It is raw yet profoundly moving; it is a novel about both holding on and letting go. This novel charts the cruel progress of ALS as Richard's life (as he knows it) is gradually changed and stripped away. His family is fractured and they are holding on to past grievances whilst dealing with the Earthquake that is ALS. The character's imperfections make them relatable and believable and whilst I didn't warm to them immediately, Lisa Genova was able to take me to their world and make me care very deeply.

",,,,,,
c,Genova delivers another heart-wrenching story. This time the focus is ALS and is told in such a way that allows the reader to want to continue to read the story and find out what happens even though you really know how it will end.,,,,,,
c,"I read this book from start to finish in a week. It was instantly engaging and captivating. Never having been through anything like ALS, I was completely enveloped in listening to and understanding Richard's experience in losing all agency and control in his life. It was heart-breaking, but kept me gripped until the end. 
",,,,,,
c,"I was very disappointed in this one. There are so many good reviews and this author is supposed to be great. Unfortunately, this one was too slow moving for me. It’s also riddled with stereotypes and cliches. It did not hook me, even a little bit.",,,,,,
c,"This book was absolutely painful to read. The plot was garbage, the characters shallow and predictable, cliches piled on cliches, and the relentless deluge of pop culture references served to only piss me off. The often pointless cultural references were akin to Family Guy's entire body of work concentrated into the power of a single lemon, as if there was a quota the author aimed to reach in each page.

c,"I read this book based on 2 personal recommendations and the strong reviews on Amazon. As such, I feel compelled to warn others: Read Player One is not worth your time. While I was disappointed with many aspects of the book, including its thin characters and poor writing, there are a two problems that deserve to be underlined. Ready Player One is fundamentally unoriginal. If you're familiar with Willy Wonka, TRON, and WALL-E, among others, you'll find nothing new in its concept and setting. The plot and characters are tropes.The premise is silly. The book centers around a contest that will decide control of a massive fortune and an extremely popular virtual reality platform. That contest amounts to a series of riddles that can be solved with knowledge of 80s pop culture. Unfortunately, the book never makes the case that any of this knowledge amounts to wisdom or that acquiring it is a demonstration of virtue. Indeed, the entire plot suggests that the contest is a dangerous way to pick a good steward. I'll be interested to see if the Spielberg adaptation overcomes these issues but the book is not worth your time.",,,,,,
c,"While this book has a good plot that will make you want to keep reading (both present and past), it is very much about the characters more than what ""happens."" The characters become so real as this story unravels and the loneliness and grief are just so palpable. This book is about loss, grief, loneliness, heartache, and maybe even despair. But it's also about the staying power of true friendship, the beauty and excitement of romantic love, and family, for better or for worse.",,,,,,
i,"I’m starting off with this: It’s not a bad book. I’m sure I would have given it two stars if I read it to the end. But, it was just a not for me book. The focus was on a divorced couple. The wife, Karina, is a natural caretaker. The husband, Richard, is a world-renowned piano player (who is also an ass). Richard gets diagnosed with ALS. They have a lot of bad blood between them. He’s losing his ability to do what he loves, just as she’s failing to become her own person after a divorce. And that’s it. I got over 50% into the book and that’s all that happened. Things happened between them in the past that caused their feelings, but it was only hinted at. Nothing was discussed. While this is written beautifully — both the lyrical prose about their relationship and the frank picture of what’s happening to Richard — but it was boring. I got bored of reading the same sentences structured in different ways.It just didn’t work for me.",,,,,,
i,"I want to be very clear here. I read quite a bit, and this is one of stupidest, sophomoric attempts at writing I have ever seen. First, the sentences are horrendously dull affairs, the narrative structure is atomically wrong, and the characters are never even described much, much less developed. Nothing is ever experienced in this book; it's just explained to you in mind-numbing I don't care detail. It's not interesting, the characters are completely flat, and the world is illogical and simultaneously thoroughly not explored. For instance, the world has been beset by the normal pablum of leftist disasters (nuclear war, global warming, environmental ruin) but this promotes sitting at home and playing a video game all day. For pretty much everyone. Stay far away. Cereal boxes are better written.",,,,,,
i,"DNF  Simplistic prose, linear style, familiar plot, clichéd shallow characters, Gross Bloody Brutality and Gore. All presented in a single voice. * Facepalm * And dull. And what's with the never-ending explanations about Twitter, the Internet, iPhones, and technology? Is this book targeted at hermits or over-80s readers? I simply cannot believe the 4- and 5-star reviews for this dull garbage, a cartoon leavened with bloody horror. Super-ugh.",,,,,,
c,"""I was okay just a moment ago. I will learn to be okay again. ""This is a quick and easy read about grief and loneliness with some truly beautiful passages. Marin abruptly left her old life in California following the death of her Gramps, her guardian since her mother's passing. Now, it's Christmas break and Marin is the only one left at her New York campus. Her old friend, Mabel, is on her way to visit for a few days, and it'll be the first time they talk or see each other in months. But being together again will force Marin to confront the secrets and regrets that have given rise to the deep loneliness inside her. It's a tender and touching story—but maybe just a little too tender and touching for my taste. I loved LaCour's prose and even highlighted a few passages, but the carefully crafted sentimentality of the story felt too much like YA. There's definitely an audience for this book and many readers who will love it. It just wasn't completely for me.",,,,,,
c,"I reserved We Are Okay from the library on a whim after reading an article on Goodreads about Nina LaCour. I was only familiar with Nina LaCour because she co-wrote You Know Me Well with David Levithan. I really enjoyed that book, so I decided I should read one of her novels. This book is quite sad. Marin’s grandfather died right before she was supposed to start college, and she’s not dealing with it very well. She escaped to NYC early and hasn’t spoken to anyone from home in a few months. It’s now Christmas break, and her best friend, Mabel, has come to the city to try to bring her home. The details of what happened in the past – between Mabel and Marin, with Marin’s grandfather, with her mother – are revealed slowly throughout this short novel. Something Marin discovered before she left California has her question everything she’s ever known. Nothing much happens in this book. It is very character-driven, but there was something beautiful about this book. I didn’t love it, but I did enjoy it. Sometimes reading something sad can be just right.",,,,,,

c,"Not a terribly original work - ""we can disappear into the machine to get away from life"" has a growing body of science fiction literature going back to the arrival of digital computers - but one written with gamers in mind (my hand just went up). It is a lightly written (death occurs but there is little mourning or other emotional impact) and at times reads like the main and side quests for an RPG. You'll probably enjoy this more if you've been around computer gaming for some time.",,,,,,
i,I don’t know how the book ends. The copy i received is misprinted and missing about 30 pages right before the start of the final climax of the story.

If you are/were a gamer/nerd in the 80's this is a highly enjoyable read. This isn't prose and there are some rough spots but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a friend. I consider this (and this is a compliment) the Michael Bay version of a Richard K Morgan book. Not heavy, great entertainment and just the right length to get your nostalgia engine going.",,,,,,

c,"I admit I am very particular when it comes to well-publicized books. I expect to find original insights, a new way of looking at humanity that rejuvenates me. Alas, this book did not deliver. The premise of the story is enticing (exploring the great divide between the wealthy and the poor, as well as attitudes about race from a suburban perspective). There was promise at first-- the rising tensions (e.g. between Mia and Mrs. Richardson) were expressed through subtle comments and gestures, which felt very natural. The struggles of the teenagers (especially Pearl and Izzy) also felt natural, and were engrossing for a while. However, as the conflicts escalated, the characters' reactions seemed to devolve until they became two-dimensional. Though they played only bit roles, the entitled male characters (Trip and Mr. Richardson), were emotionally limited and frankly stereotypical, which, rather than elevating the females in the story, makes their attachments (e.g., Pearl's crush on Trip) superficial as well. Then Mia, the outcast who most of the conflicts centered around, became so empathic by comparison that the other characters elevated her to near-sainthood. She was so consumed with her art and the wellbeing of her daughter that she never, ever experienced love, or even desired a romantic partner (really??). Meanwhile young Izzy, the classic rebel, escapes her suburban hell while her mother, whose life is controlled by a strict set of rules, does not even attempt to go find her. This could-have-been literary novel would have been more worthwhile if the author did not allow her plot to not wrap up so neatly, and allowed her characters to be more ambivalent and multi-dimensional.",,,,,,

c,"i picked this book up because June was Pride Month. I already read HIGHLY ILLOGICAL BEHAVIOR, and I thought to read a lesbian character or a female bisexual or a transgender. basically, i want to read a book where the narrator is a girl. because I've been reading mostly gay male teens. I guess because this was not the book I was feeling to be read or something, I started this book quite slow. even with that, the emotions in this book I have to applaud because they are very compelling, I'm not much of a fan of drama or sadness. I mean, I do read them. but this book brought out some lonely feelings in me. which is good because it means the author has amazing effective writing. but bad for me because I didn't want to feel that way. i personally think the story was quite dragging. but when I got to the part where Marin tells Mabel everything, things started to pick up for me until I finished it. like i said this brought some sadness in me, which, like Marin, made me remember my own memories... as i mentioned, very effective writing! and as the story goes, this effectiveness was constant which makes me want to dive in more. I liked the resolution and the ending. i just did not see that coming. Actually, if I made guesses on how the book goes, I would be totally off. I just find the unpredictability of this book very refreshing. for me the story was good. and let's just leave it at that.",,,,,,

c,"I love getting lost in a book that transports me to a different time and place, a different life and does it with authenticity. I felt the setting in Alaska was authentic and a true representation. The writing is very picturesque and describes homesteading in a way to make me really understand how hard it was back in the 70s. The descriptions of the ocean, bays, Kenai river, sea life, salmon fishing, hunting, severe winter, mountains, northern lights, rain, mud, snow, dark days of winter, 18-hours of daylight in summer, etc., was all pretty amazing. The story line is also good which has been described enough in other reviews. people in town, Cora’s parents, etc. Good story, several surprising twists and local characters. Not depressing at all. The cover is a little strange with the almost freeway looking stream lights but don't let that sway you.",,,,,,
c,"Somewhere around the half way mark I skimmed more than I read. The tension in the story became the same. The storyline became predictable. ""Thoughts"" and ""letters"" took the place of dialog and characters.

There's a nice little romance brewing in the story as well.",,,,,,
c,"At first, I was a little put off by the pace of the book because it was so slow. Usually I fly through the first thirty pages when I start a new book because I'm so excited to learn everything that makes up the world and the characters, but with this book I was forced to slow down. And I loved the experience! I noticed the details of the story as they were eventually revealed, and understood them on a much deeper level because they were described so thoroughly.",,,,,,
c,An intense study of grief balanced with a strong portrayal and endorsement for Art.,,,,,,
c,"I LOVED this book, it joins the list of my top favorite books ever (and I read a lot). The author does an amazing job of describing Alaska, both the place itself and it's unique challenges and heart. The story is complex and often times sad, but always so touching. I can honestly say it is the first book I ever remember actually crying while reading (and more than once). The book shares Alaska with us and offers insight into PTSD, brain injuries, life in the wilderness, abuse, family, friendships, truth, hurt, and so much more, but mostly, it is about the love of a mother (all mothers) for her child (children). I definitely could not put the book down and will be thinking about it for a long time to come. For me it is a good book when I turn the last page and am sad to be leaving the characters, wanting more. This book definitely did that and I am thrilled to know that it is being made into a movie (I actually found myself thinking that throughout the story, what a movie this would make!) and we can look forward to experiencing them once more.",,,,,,
i,"DNF. Trigger warning. Today I did something that I rarely do. I stopped reading a book before I could finish it. I feel guilty, but I wish I had researched this one a little more before I started it. I thought since it was marketed for teens, it couldn’t be too big for me to handle. I knew it included a storyline that touches on suicide and depression, but I didn’t realize how triggering it would be. When I read a book, the story becomes my story and the emotions become very real to me as an empathetic person. This book got to me, but unfortunately it only reminded me of bad memories and kind of dragged me down. I don’t think it should be a novel marketed for teens for this reason. It’s a good story and I think it has a lot of good points, but 300 pages in, I realized what it was doing to me and I don’t think I’m going to finish it for a long time. Maybe never. The writing style was very descriptive, elegant and colorful and the title suits it perfectly. I appreciated how the characters would describe their feelings as colors; super cool concept to me. It just isn’t for me as a person with a history of depression and self harm.",,,,,,

c,"I hated the story, but loved the writing. Girls Burn Brighter by Shobha Rao is a beautifully written book about the friendship of Poornima and Savitha, 2 Indian girls surviving horrific abuses in a culture where women are not valued. It is not that I actually hated the story, but that it is one that could easily have been a news story as the abuses endured by our lovely heroines is a disgusting reality for many women. This book is beyond words the way it both makes you so uncomfortable and yet is also so poetically beautiful in the bond of these two girls, and the strength of women. (loved the beginning story of the trees) This book made me feel, it was gut wrenching, without the emotional manipulation of making me love a character and then making me lose the character or feel the character's loss of something/someone that some authors employ to make the reader cry, instead this book made me feel resilient, empowered, inspired, wanting to get out in the world and make a difference somehow. Making me want to know more and do more for other women out there in a world that would value them so little. I am just amazed at the writing in the book and can not recommend it enough. This is one of the books that make me so grateful to have discovered the GoodReads Giveaways, for if I had not won this book I would probably not have picked it up to read, but I am so thankful that I did read it. One of the better books I have read this year. ",,,,,,

If you like D&D and Big Bang Theory you will probably enjoy this.",,,,,,
i,"I couldn't stay with the book long enough to finish it. Grammar and punctuation was so atrocious as to be distracting. Some sentences read as if they started with one thought, author went back to change it, but failed to re-read the new sentence to see if it made sense. Grammar-check would have been a God-send to this endeavor. There were also constant question marks at the end of declarative sentences, etc. I'm not an English teacher nor anything close to it, but I am an avid reader of many genres. The story might have been good, but I got so tired of trying to decipher it and make sense of non-sensical sentences that I just gave up.

Since then, I’ve heard it’s an incredibly brutal story, which I just don’t have in me right now.",,,,,,

I am not one to shy away from certain subjects but there was an incident in the novel that was even hard for me to get thru. When I first started this novel I did not think that I was going to finish it because it didn’t capture me right at first but once I was into the story, I was hooked! This story is set in India for most of the novel and I am so glad that I have read I Am Malala because it allowed me to be familiar with the setting. This is one of those debut novels that people are going to be hungover from after reading it because it is so intense and touches on subjects that society likes to put blinders up to, especially if it is happening in another part of the world that you are not familiar with.

DNF @ ~64%

This book is kind of a hot mess: The characters are terrible and the mystery is not great and the whole thing is rife with lazy stereotypes with a side of racial slurs. 

Why was it necessary to make a character Jewish and then also make that character greedy, money hungry and cheap? Honestly, there’s just no need to perpetuate that kind of stereotype. And authors using racial slurs in their books really irritates me. It’s just so unnecessary. Pick a different word. 

All in all, this was a huge miss for me and I am really hesitant to pick up any of this authors other work.

Question your state of mind before you read this. If you're in a good place just tread carefully. If you're not, leave this one alone. I'm sorry Ms. Hannah, but the subject matter is so raw that there are some people who should NEVER read your book. I finished this book today..my birthday..and started my day bawling!

There is no subtlety to these references he just spergs them out, they don't advance anything, they aren't even phrased in an interesting way. They say sarcasm is the lowest form of wit it isnt the lowest form of wit is referencing something it requires no creativity. The dialogue is the cringiest I have ever encountered. Only a teenager would think this is how people talk. The main character seems to be a self insert of the Author and is utterly loathsome. Partially due to the aforementioned dialogue, partially due to the fact he cares only about himself. I can't understand how this book is a New York Times bestseller and has a film directed by Steven Spielberg. My opinion of both the human race and Spielberg has declined as a result.",,,,,,

If they see potential, I defer to their judgment. Great concepts that I'm positive will be flushed out better on screen. For me this is purely a nostalgia read written completely in a young adult style, and while it brings some interesting ideas to the table, I kept finding myself cringing at every attempt at character development. The sci-fi aspects are great, and the social commentary of the close at hand dystopian future, energy crisis and widespread unemployment will resonate with most. Rebel against the corporate overlords taking over to force relentless advertising on the futureworld, and the fight to preserve choice and independence! Philip K Dick would love it.Unfortunately there's a ""love story"" jammed in there based on the main character creepily stalking another ""hot"" animated character, coupled with a lot of exposition of how much they like each other without any evidence.

c,"THE FOUTH MONKEY (4MK) by talented author J.D. Barker is a dark and twisting novel; a combination of Se7en meets The Silence of the Lambs. Psychological thrillers are my favourite genre so was very much looking forward to reading it. As I started to read it, I was transported to a time when I watched my favourite movie, Se7en. I was drawn and hooked to this book, and had work not got in the way, I would have finished it earlier. I would describe The Fourth Monkey as very graphic in parts and not for the faint-hearted. The Four Monkey Killer (4MK) was a serial killer, who tortured his victims before killing them, mailing body parts back to their families. I enjoy reading books about serial killers in order to understand what makes them tick, getting inside the mind of a deranged and twisted character. Who is he? Why does he do this? The Four Monkeys comes from a shrine in Japan, where there is a carving above the entrance. “HEAR NO EVIL, SEE NO EVIL, SPEAK NO EVIL. THE FOURTH MONKEY REPRESENTS, DO NO EVIL.” The serial killer follows this pattern. The Four Monkey Killer (4MK) has terrorized the residents of Chicago, for over five years. There had been a massive manhunt for this serial killer. When his body is found, the police soon realize he was on his way to deliver one final message, one which proves he has taken another victim who may still be alive. Detective Sam Porter had been there from the beginning. As the lead investigator on the 4MK task force, Detective Sam Porter discovers a personal diary in the jacket pocket of the body, and Porter finds himself caught up in the mind of a psychopath. He must now try to save the life of a young girl…caught in the middle by this sadistic killer. “With only a handful of clues, the elusive killer’s identity remains a mystery. Time is running out and the Four Monkey Killer taunts from beyond the grave in this masterfully written fast-paced thriller.” The novel is told from multiple pints of view with the main two being Detective Sam Porter and from 4MK’s diary. This diary tells the story of his life from childhood to the evil monster he became. This diary is creepy and gave me the chills…but I had to know why! This is a very well written novel with engaging and flawed characters to add depth and tension to the story. An easy five stars for me. Preorder this novel. It will be worth your time! I predict that this novel is going to be one of the most talked about books of the year! I received an ARC copy of this novel. All opinions are my own and my review it unbiased. Expected publication: June 27th 2017 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt ",,,,,,
c,"Loved this book. I love the main character and wish I could be more like her. The story was gripping and I could not put it down, can not wait for the next instalment.",,,,,,
c,"Thank you to NetGalley and Macmillan - Tor/Forge for a digital galley of this novel. This is a retelling of the Shakespeare play King Lear mainly identifiable by the leading characters of Lear and his three daughters along with his decision to carve up his kingdom to benefit the daughters who can express their love for him better than her sisters. The main problem is that you have to read way, way into the book before you get to that pithy bit of Shakespeare's maneuvering of characters.  The Queens of Innis Lear has wonderfully lyrical prose and yet I came away feeling very ambivalent about the characters. I couldn't seem to work up any emotional attachment for them or their predicament-of-the-moment. There is earth magic in here - as in being able to communicate with the trees and elements - which I normally enjoy and liked here too. There are all sorts of misunderstandings about events that happened in the past and we are given many flashback opportunities to see for ourselves what actually happened but only after we have watched characters struggle with their misconceptions of those events over long segments of the book. When I'm reading a novel and find myself frequently wondering how many pages there are in the book, well, that's not usually a good sign. For me this one is firmly in the 3 star category. I'm glad I read it (even though it took me a rather long time to get through it), but have zero desire to read it a second time.",,,,,,
c,I felt the book chopped and changed too much. Couldn't quite the characters. In parts it rolled along and then very abruptly changed too much. Storylines were ok and believable. Don't like two authors in a book. Continuity is lost.,,,,,,

c,"This book is honestly severely overrated. The author covers up the third grade level writing and thin story/characters with numerous highly verbose descriptions of random obscure 80s technology that take up over half the length of this novel. If this interests you then you will love this book as it might as well be the wikipedia page for trendy retro 80s tech. In terms of the actual story it is literally the most basic story structure one can write, literally something straight out of 3rd grade narrative writing class. The vocabulary is highly basic and the prevalence of ""leet speak"" is unnecessary and is an anachronism as these obscure terms would be phased out for sure by the time this book takes place. The characters are all very thinly written and most of them serve a one time use tier purpose. The main characters seems to be all of the average teenage gamers dreams come true which may be the reason for the extensive success of this awful book. There is also an extensive passage on the health benefits of masturbation and also a highly unnecessary scene with the main character and a sex doll for no apparent reason other than to validate the concerns of the author in regards to these matters. If you have an extensive addiction to 80s retro tech you will like this book, otherwise I would steer clear.",,,,,,
i,First chapters have to grab you. This one was painful. Left me too cold to continue to chapter two.,,,,,,
c,"I didn’t know what to expect with this one? I’ve seen plenty of positive reviews but an equal amount of unimpressed. I really loved it though. I read this short book in one day and the emotions were so vivid and real in the way LaCour expresses them. The book is pretty sad, as the main character Marin deals with depression and trauma after a difficult loss, but by the end, the book was infused with hope. It’s a small book but it packs a punch!",,,,,,
c,"This is the first book of Nina Lacour’s that I have read. I admit that I was immediately drawn to it mainly because of the gorgeous cover art, but this book is so much more than pretty. This book, more than any other I have yet read, captures the loneliness of intense grief and what it is like trying to come through it alive. This book is a very quick read, but do not let that fool you on its quality or Lacour’s ability to capture such complex emotions or feelings in her characters.",,,,,,

i,Read a little. Seemed to be somewhat immature PC chick lit. Low toleerance for PC and boring detail and immature chick worldview. Gave up. Maybe OK for PC women.,,,,,,
c,"Little fires is a fast easy read. It kept my attention for 3/4 of the book. Then it kind of tanked. The last few chapters were like a bunch of streamers needing to be tied up. And, Voila' , they were. Mia, an artist and a gypsy-like mother was too adept at solving problems. Indeed, she had solutions and insight into her daughter, Pearl, the teens,Lexie, and Izzie, and her co worker. The male male characters were flat and unimportant. Of course, Mia, being a virgin, despite having a daughter, Pearl, was a bit much. Half way thru the book, we find that Mia has never even seen a naked man. So, from that revelation on, it was hard to take the book seriously!",,,,,,
c,Didn't find the story line or characters interesting at all. Kept reading and hoping it would get better but nothing. Just boring in my opinion.,,,,,,
i,"Feels like a scam. I want my money back. I am not sure how a book so poor ended up with so many good reviews. I did not end up going through more than half the book. Amazon used to have a way to send it back, cant find this feature any more though....",,,,,,
c,"Always entertaining, imaginative. I tend to DNF a lot of stuff lately, as I care about the writing not the story. I finished this which makes it an automatic 4 stars. But this was more like watching an orgy rather than being part of it. Didn't cut very deep.",,,,,,
c,"This book is awful. Such a disappointment after the NIGHTENGALE !! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME READING ! It felt like a grade schooler wrote this ,, I can’t tell you how sad I was to spend this much money on a waste of reading time",,,,,,
i,"Perhaps I'm too young to have the correct shade of nostalgia goggles for this book, but wow, this is a rough read. Sometimes it feels like it was written by an angsty fourteen year old who just needs someone to want him, and the rest of the time it feels like it's written by a grown man who's still traumatized from when he was a fourteen year old who just needed someone to want him. The whole thing is basically your basic youth reliving and fulfillment covered in lazy nostalgia vomit. I could only take about 5 chapters of it before I gave up, and I've slogged my way through some pretty atrocious sci-fi/fantasy in the past. The book feels like it has promise. It feels like it could cultivate a world like Snow Crash, something I find rather intriguing. But I just can't shake the feeling that it's an adult's pathetic fantasies with all the skill of a rough draft of a teenager's novel. It's like bad erotica except instead of shoehorned, poorly done sex scenes, there's shoehorned, poorly done nostalgia explosions of increasingly obscure '80s games and TV shows.",,,,,,
c,"A gorgeous, gut-wrenching story of loss, loneliness, and learning to let other people in. Although WE ARE OKAY doesn't have much of a plot, I was captivated regardless by both the delicate specificity of the prose and by Marin's journey toward recovery. Once the flashbacks were introduced I found my footing in a hurry, and when I reached the final page I couldn't help wishing that I had more time with these characters. Watching them grow into their new lives and new selves was a joy, even when it was extraordinarily painful. Nina LaCour is one of my favorite contemporary YA authors, and she can break my freaking heart anytime she wants.",,,,,,
i,"Yikes- I just received my new paperback of Ready Player One and it's going to be brutal trying to read it. The book is flimsy, the print is tiny, and the paper looks and feels like low grade newsprint (definitely not slick or white in any sense). I'd return it, but the cost of postage would be too much. I recommend finding another version to buy (I'm probably going to get the Kindle version so I can actually read the book).",,,,,,
i,"Sadly, I DNF. I did try and I got to 100 pages before I returned it back to the library. There wasn't anything wrong per se other than it did not hold my interest. I do enjoy Neil Gaiman's work, but this was not one I could get into.",,,,,,
c,"This book lays bare so many areas of life. It explains much about single parenting , having no roots to speak of. Living life in the shadow of fear, physical abuse, the torment of someone suffering from PTSD and its effects on the individual and their families. Tbe difficulties of having to learn to be ever vigilent in a wild and unforgiving location. The strength and friendship of those who choose to live in a beautiful but harsh environment. The strength of love and sometimes hate and what it can drive a person to do. It teaches a lot about human nature, love and resilience that we as a people live with on a daily basis. I really enjoyed this book as I laughed, cried and felt so many emotions for the characters and what they were experiencing.",,,,,,
c,"I truly loved The Nightingale even though it was difficult to read sometimes. Not so with The Great Alone. I suppose you could call it a coming of age story set in the far reaches of Alaska. It is written in first person point-of-view of a young girl I just couldn't care enough about to engage with the very dark and dysfunctional issues. Long passages of narrative made it move at an agonizing pace. I usually like Kristen Hannah, but I couldn't recommend this novel to anyone.",,,,,,

c,"Marin is spending Christmas break at the dorm. She is trying to avoid going home at all costs. Her best friend, Mabel, comes to visit and try to convince Marin to come back home with her. But Mabel does not know the whole story of why Marin left and Marin is reluctant to tell her. Will she? Will doing so help her to begin to heal? This was a decent quick read and the characters were interesting but the plot, to me, was not fully developed. I received this book from Amazon Vine in exchange for a honest review.",,,,,,
c,"Okay, so people have been telling me to read Neil Gaiman for ages. They assume I've read American Gods because the premise is similar to the Percy Jackson series. Well, I still haven't read American Gods, but I did pick up Neverwhere in the Heathrow airport and read it on the way back home. I enjoyed it a lot. Great fantasy, wonderful sense of humor. I can understand why Gaiman is so popular. I'll have to look up his other books.",,,,,,
c,"I grew up in the '80s. My first PC was a TRS-80 Model I. I loved Tron and Star Wars IV. The author of this book did his homework for all of the 80s nostalgia in this book, but only went back to the TRS-80 CoCo2. The extrapolation of Virtual Reality into the not-so-distant future is completely believable, and has been touched upon in the Divergent movies. Being inside a virtual world has a similar feel as the first Tron movie. The bad-guys chasing the good guys was done in the movie War Games. The VR technology was available in the 1990s, but back then it was primitive. Today with VR making a comeback, the technology looks like the beginning of an arc that could end up in this book. The beginning of the story almost turned me off the book, as it was preachy, and the real-world not-to-distant future seemed very far fetched. Once the story got rolling, though, with the real feeling of how dangerous the bad guys are, I had no trouble reading the rest of the book. Most of the characters are believable, but a little flat. Since I lived some of the history presented here, the storyline was very predictable to me. That wasn't a bad thing to me in the same way that I can see a roller coaster before I ride on it, but I can still enjoy the ride. I finished this book in a weekend, and enjoyed it well enough, if for no other reason than the sheer abundance of the nostalgia. Plus, I hear there is going to be a movie based on this book. I'll probably go to see it, and pray that the movie doesn't stink.

c,"It was a good book. I'm glad I have read it. Gaiman created a fantastic world. But for me, something is missing to give it a higher grade. And the biggest problem I have with the book is that the characters felt a bit flat. I just didn't care much for anyone of them. A great book makes you care about the characters, suffer with them all the way, and mourn for them if something happens. It just didn't happen with me with this book.",,,,,,
c,It could have been written in 1/4 of the words.,,,,,,
c,"For me this was just the right balance of whimsy and mythological drama. A fun urban fantasy refreshingly free of vampires and werewolves. There is real elegance how it hooks you in and takes you on a wild ride. The heroes are minimally sketched ciphers the readers are invited to project themselves into. They take shape mainly from their quests: Richard wants to get back his ordinary boring life; Door wants to avenge the murder of her family; Hunter wants to kill the Great Beast of London. They join forces to overcome several challenges in the weird and scary underground world of the “London Below”. The power structure of this society depends on bartering and favors, so it is impossible to tell who to trust. The most evil and supernaturally powerful characters in this tale, Mr. Vandemar and Mr. Croup, take so much fun in their mayhem, you can’t help liking them (“Can't make an omelette without killing a few people”). If you want to know if the book is the right read for you, the time it takes to peruse a reasonable sample of the 7,000 reviews on Goodreads might better be spent just diving into the rabbit hole and reading the book.",,,,,,

c,"Although I thought the premise was interesting , this book was a waste of money for me . The characters are very one dimensional- either categorized as “good” or “bad” -",,,,,,

c,"And boringly predictable . The story is mostly plot driven and there are just basic , shallow explanations as to why the characters are acting the way they are . Very little mystery . I would have really enjoyed this in my early teens but not as an adult . The writing is good , and I would have liked it if it had been more of a psychological thriller than an action book. It also bothered me that the Dad was considered the big villain , but the Mom is just as terrible a parent as he is for how little she cares about her daughter . Yet , the mom is ultimately forgiven and portrayed more positively than the Dad . It seemed really cliche . I guess the content is just not my style .",,,,,,

NYC at Christmas is AWESOME with so much to do and see and my college Freshman year I met new friends - it was very exciting. However Marin is from San Francisco which can be gorgeous or it can be foggy damp chilly and she is doing her best to keep herself together knowing that she is alone in the world. Her mother died years ago, her grandfather who she lived with and adored is gone and she has no one in her life from the last 18 years who knows her.

But Neverwhere failed to grab me completely. It wasn't that it was written very badly, no. It was all just so uninteresting. Richard, Door, the different Londons: I just couldn't get myself to care. Nothing in this book stood out as new, fun, or interesting, and I was so bored while reading this. Then from page 210 I started skimming the whole thing, and I decided that maybe it'd be best if I'd just put it away and never pick it up again.",,,,,,
c,"2.5A fun adventure. Clever in its premise and world building with light dialogs. I wish I had connected more with the characters. Gaiman has a ver particular way of getting you into his stories, he's very intense and throws at you all this information at once, it works if you are invested in the story, sadly I found it hard to keep reading and wasn't that interested in the problems or solutions during the book. But still, the author imagination is something to make a standing ovation.",,,,,,
c,"Ugh. Truly painful read. Insufferable writing. Mansplaining. Name dropping passed off as nostalgia. Wade Watts is hard to root for, with very little character development.

c,"For me this is going to be a book hangover kind of book. What do I read next that will hold my attention as much as this one did? (I'm trying not to spoil anything in the book so my review is vague..like my mind.) You should all know that little saying with the monkeys..see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil? The four monkey killer takes that to extremes. He has four little monkeys by adding in 'do no evil'...those monkeys are evil little henchmen. Just saying. Detective Sam Porter (who is frigging awesome) has been chasing old monkey killer boy for five years. Now they find out that someone has jumped in front of a bus and it's looking like it might have been Monkey boy. BUT he has a surprise. He has that ever awful box that serial killers love. And a diary in his pocket. That little diary is the history of how the Monkey killer came to exist..and it's a hot mess. Our boy has been busy.This was one of those that just fit all the pieces for me. The detective and his crew were just perfect..snarky and dedicated. (I'd share some of the quotes from the book that made my day but mine was an ARC copy and we are supposed to behave until the book is out...stupid rules.)
The killer is smart and a creepo. I didn't figure stuff out that happened..I thought I had but my butt was dead wrong. Pure goodness. There was one little place that didn't fit into the story by tying it up that bugged me but it wasn't enough to keep me from throwing up all the stars for this one. Give me book two in a dang hurry!

The book sucks you in from the very first pages and being that I am from the ""Vietnam War/Conflict"" era it was all the more appealing. If you do not like intense books, this is not the book for you. I was actually mentally transported to Alaska and could visualize every thing that Leni, her mother and piece of crap dad (I will give him the PTSD and POW experience), but I think he was on his way to becoming a piece of crap before going off to Nam and then becoming a POW just exacerbated that behavior. Even though I am ""The Spoiler""....this book was sooooo good that all I'm going to say is buy it and read it.",,,,,,
c,"Marin has just finished her first semester at college. She has decided to stay in the dorms between semesters instead of go home to San Francisco because she doesn't want to deal with all that she has left behind. Her best friend, Mable, is coming to stay, so she really needs to start to face the things that she has left behind. If I could say anything about this book, it would be that this is loneliness. If a student was to ask me to pull a book that really dives into that feeling, this would be the first book that comes to mind now. It seems like this feeling just clings to Marin and at the heart of everything, loneliness is underlying. Even though Mable is coming to visit, the majority of this book is the internal conflicts that are happening inside of Marin. It's a very reflective book that takes you deep into her being. She has to deal with some major issues even though she doesn't want to face them. It's often easier to run away than to pick through all of those jumbled things, but this book makes you pick through them. It's beautifully written, and even though you will most likely cry, it is worth the read.",,,,,,
c,"PC sucks, JFC is absolutely sick to death of the PC regime. One of the most oppressive ideaology ever to come to power since the Nazi's and Communists. More insipid because of its' soft tyranny.

c,"I have never read a book with more despicable characters in my life. Both of the main characters are immature, insecure, snarky, alcoholic teenagers. They both act like the stereotypical, popular mean kids at school who are unkind to everyone else around them. The main plot of the book happens within the first 10% of the book. Then the rest of the book is filled with one jealous spat after another. I lost count of how many times they got mad at each other for talking to another person. This is love? It got old, fast, for them to constantly get drunk and doubt each other.",,,,,,
c,"All I can say is...WOW! Inside the depraved mind of a serial killer. The cold, chilling evil. So what is it about serial killer books? Curious, human nature I suppose. This is my third one this month, and by far the most disturbing. Normally I avoid these but they seem to be “creeping” into my library. Each one getting darker and more sinister. And I’m so glad I picked this one up. Everything you’ve heard about this book is true...it's just that good! The fourth monkey represents “Do No Evil.” Dispensing his own brand of vigilante justice. And the goal - punish a family member who’s relative has run afoul of the law. A recent accident leaves a man dead in the street. It appears that luck is on the side of law enforcement and the man hit by the bus is no other than the infamous 4MK (Fourth Monkey Killer). For half a decade the city of Chicago has endured a nightmare that left 7 girls murdered in its wake. Can the good people of Chicago finally breathe a sigh of relief? Come on now, nothing is ever that simple. Evidence is found next to the dead man that shows there may be one more victim out there...and this one may still be alive! With the clock ticking, detectives Porter and Nash fight against time and fearful citizens, to find the killer’s next victim before it's too late. Told through several points of view including the killer's own diary - The deep, dark journey into the world of a madman. Disturbing, twisted. (My favorite parts). Although I had a few plot lines figured out, there were plenty of bumps and shocking moments. And ooh, the ending!! Absolutely could not put it down. Again...WOW! Highly recommend. Thank you to NetGalley, J.D. Barker and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt for an ARC to review. ",,,,,,

c,"This stand alone novel by Caroline Mitchell is a great read. I started the book very shortly after receiving it and due to the suspense built up by the author was unable to put it down. Emma loves her husband Alex and together with her son they are moving to a new home in Leeds. But Emma has a dark secret, for a number of years she’s been hiding the dead body of Luke, the teacher who seduced her as a teen. The book is written from the perspective of Emma, then and now, her husband Alex and Luke at the time when he was Emma's teacher. I don't want to give too much away but this psychological novel is top drawer and is a must for all suspense readers. Very good characters and a plot that is excellently paced. Even though the story is told from different characters and time frames the story was easy to follow and was a great read. I would like to thank Net Galley and Thomas & Mercer for supplying a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review.",,,,,,

c,"Do you like books that keep you up late at night because there is just NO way you can put it down until you find out the truth? What about books that are relentlessly paced with short chapters that end on mini cliffhangers leaving you reading chapter after chapter until you realize you’re finished? Or what about books that are full of thrills and excitement but also have a domestic suspense vibe chock full of secrets and lies? If you answered yes to these questions then please allow me to introduce you to the work of the fabulous Caroline Mitchell! Over the past two years she’s become one of my favorite authors, I can always count on her for an original storyline and some serious heart pounding moments and Silent Victim may be her best book yet. This is told from several viewpoints and flips between 2017, 2013 and 2002 but everything is laid out clearly, there is no confusion but just loads of intrigue. The premise of this hooked me instantly, Emma killed her teacher years ago, but she didn’t mean to and she’s been living in fear ever since. When she digs up his grave and finds it empty things start to go downhill, fast. That’s as far as I’ll be discussing the plot because this went in SO many unexpected directions that I don’t want to reveal much. The tension is insane and the guessing game was endless, I was doubtful and distrusting of everyone at some point and the ending left me gasping for breath. Another hit from one of my auto buy authors, if you haven’t read her books yet they’re all highly recommended by me. Silent Victim in three words: Nerve wracking, exciting and Menacing.",,,,,,

Author's writing style keeps your interest, keeps you in suspense. Thrilling, mysterious and suspenseful all the way to the breathtaking ending. Books written by British authors always takes me longer to read, because I have to stop and Google the places and read the news, look at the pictures. Hope to visit Mersea one day.",,,,,,
i,"DNF, skimmed through to figure out what happened. I’m in the minority; most readers enjoyed the story. SILENT VICTIM is told from the points of view of Emma, her husband Alex and Luke, the man Emma “murdered” from time periods of 2002, 2003, 2013 and 2017. I was often confused whose first person POV I was reading and from what time period. I didn’t like or feel connected to any of the characters, didn’t know who was a reliable narrator or not and didn’t care.",,,,,,
c,This was an Amazon Kindle First monthly read. My recent monthly picks have been pretty mediocre but this one was surprisingly good! I had a hard time putting it down. There are lots of twists and turns and it's really hard to predict how it will end. Nearly every single character is completely crazy so that just adds to the intrigue.,,,,,,
c,I am surprised by all the hype about this book. I kept reading in order to find out where all the glowing reviews were coming from. I wish I hadn't wasted my time. It was boring and predictable. I did not like ANY of the characters and am baffled as to the point of the whole mess. I wish I belonged to a book club so that someone could explain to me why everyone else seemed to like this book.,,,,,,

c,"This is really a good read that keeps you guessing until the very exciting end. There were a couple of patches in this book that I feel we’re a little illogical in terms of the main character’s choices... But ignoring these gaps, it was actually very original and enjoyable.",,,,,,
c,"So many raving review and yet, I just could not love this book. Most of the characters' depth was skimmed and other mundane details hammered in. The plot line was well crafted, but ultimately I think the book could have been much, much more.",,,,,,
c,Absolutely bored the entire read. Characters are 1-ply toilet paper and the story is a non-stop namedrop that had me skimming entire chapters just to get through it.,,,,,,

c,"I received this book ""The Sun Does Shine"" from Netgalley for my honest review. This was an amazing read. Anthony Ray Hinton was arrested and charged with a crime he did not commit. He was at work where there was a guard and you had to sign in and out. There were other employees who should have been able to tell the police that he was at work. But he was arrested because he was a poor black man. The police did not care about him they only cared that they were going to close the case. The state of Alabama didn't care either. When trying to appeal, the state of Alabama didn't care about his rights or the fact that he had proof that he was innocent. He could have been put to death. He was on death row watching as the state put inmates to death. The state of Alabama took 30 years of his life! I was interested in how his life was going throughout the book. You need to have hope and faith and good people trying to help you. This book was well written and although it does have a lot of legal jargon it was interesting and not at all boring. ",,,,,,

c,"If you want to be reminded of what it's like growing up in the 80s while reading a boring and predictable story with one-dimensional characters that experience no growth or real challenges, then this is the book for you. I honestly don't know how I finished this giant stack of nothing.",,,,,,
i,"Nightengale was such a good book that I looked forward to this one. Well, I'm on page 133 and trying to muster the enthusiasm to finish. It's close to impossible to enjoy a book when you hate the characters. Ernt is a jerk regardless of the excuses make for him. Cora is no better, enabling the abuse and subjecting her daughter to that hideous life. They have no money but he seems to have all the liquor he can drink. Seriously?",,,,,,
c,"This is a horrific serial killer thriller that will have you reading non stop till the end with its gripping narrative. Sam Porter is a Chicago detective dealing with a personal trauma that has him on leave. Then he gets a call from his partner, Brian Nash, to get himself pronto to a traffic death. For five years, Sam has been trying to get the Fourth Monkey serial killer, who sends three white boxes consecutively, containing the ear, the eyes and tongue of the victim alluding to the three monkeys who hear, see and speak no evil. This is to punish a relative of the victim, who turns out to have done evil in direct contradiction to the fourth monkey saying, do no evil. This is a dark tale, lightened only by the humour and banter of Sam's team. The traffic death is that of the serial killer, who was in the process of posting a white box with an ear in it. Sam and his team race to find the final victim before she dies. There are several items on the body of the killer, all of which are vital clues for the police as the killer taunts them from beyond the grave. One is a journal, that Sam reads, that depicts the childhood of the killer with his parents and their next door neighbours, the Carters. It is a grisly read with parts I do not care to dwell on, I really don't need the nightmares. The killer has a close relationship with his parents, particularly his father. who instills the need to be polite at all times. What happens is directly related to the police investigation. The victim turns out to be fifteen year old Emory Connors, the illegitimate daughter of Arthur Talbot, a powerful and wealthy man. As Sam and his team try to get to the bottom of what exactly Talbot has done and find Emory, there is twist after twist until the connections come together and the surprising truth comes to light. It is odd to think of a serial killer being driven by the moral imperative to put an end to evil deeds. This moral ambiguity gives rise to some questions, a man who does despicable things to innocents, to punish the guilty? Is it possible to feel empathy for the killer? Then there is the final twist which does not give Sam's reaction to the act. An impressively plotted novel with a narrative that is bound to hit the bestseller lists. A brilliantly gruesome read that I highly recommend. Thanks to Harlequin for an ARC.",,,,,,
i,Just received the book yesterday. Looking forward to digging into it. Thanks Goodreads and St. Martin's Press for the advance reader copy.,,,,,,
c,"I got this book for my daughter, she is an avid reader and enjoys multiple different genres. This was a shorter read for her but she still found it very enjoyable. The book has well developed characters and she was pleased that the plot followed through. Throughout this book the main characters use the past to resolve conflicts between each other. The first person perspective gives a personal feel to even the smallest details like the surroundings. The writing style is concise and feels again very personal. Limited setting with constant descriptions of a harsh winter being outside reinforce a feeling of closeness between the two girls as they work through the past and try to repair their relationship in the wake of change. The emotions in the book are very real, it is so easy to relate to the characters feelings and struggles. The book ends with a fulfilling outcome and is definitely worth the read.",,,,,,
i,I received this book from Goodreads giveaway. I got to page 30. I thought the book was about his time in prison. It was interesting. Till the part about him sleeping with other people's wives and girlfriends. I don't really see why this was in the book.,,,,,,
c,After reading this book I felt like I had just wasted one week and $15. It was a lot of words with little purpose. Probably one of the worse books I've ever read. Nothing positive to say.,,,,,,
c,This truly made me look at my beliefs on the Death Sentence. I don't say that lightly. I'm one of those people who feels certain crimes deserve the Death Sentence especially when our prisons today treat the prisoners better than homeless people are treated. I guess I never really considered someone who could be innocent. Call me naive! I am truly appalled at what happened to Ray. I praise God for bringing it to light and using Bryan and his team to do that. I don't know that I could be so forgiving as Ray is. Thank you Ray for sharing your life. I will be praying that God uses your life story for His Glory!,,,,,,
c,The beginning was good and kept my interest ,,,,,,
c,"What a terrible book. It is written from the perspective of someone in high school. It also appears to be written by someone on high school. Every possible cliche is used on this book. It is extremely painful to read this book. Very poorly written.

c,"A hard book to review. You can’t say it’s a good book as actually it’s horrendous, meet Ray, an innocent man who spent 30 years on death row, at times I felt like this was just a story, pages of fiction, but then it would hit that this is actually someone life. It’s absolutely shocking the way this case was handled. An interesting read and as close to death row as you’d ever want to get. Interesting side story’s with other fellow death row prisoners that lead to interesting google searches. Well worth a read and I will definitely follow Ray’s progress.",,,,,,
c,"Anthony Ray Hinton is roughly my age. When Hinton went to prison for a crime he didn't commit, I was having my first child. By the time he was released from death row, my 'child' was 30 years old. It's hard to wrap one's mind around the depth of the injustice experienced by Ray Hinton. His book is a moving testimony to the human spirit of resilience and hope. Love, faith, books, imagination and Bryan Stevenson conspired to keep Hinton alive and eventually released. An amazing story - and a must-read. To be published in March 2018.",,,,,,
c,"A cross between a blunt but heart-felt memoir and a medical mystery; Abby delves into life with chronic pain and a medical system which refuses to believe it. I appreciated that she early (and more than once) noted that despite the title; women are not defined by their ownership of a uterus. More than that; as a woman who has had her own medical woes, I recognized and can certainly empathize with the many familiar ways in which Abby has navigated a health care system which has always been Men First and Women Last (if ever). Her narrative was at times a bit rambling but overall this was a fascinating and compelling mix of medical history, scientific research, and self-inspection which I didn't want to put down.",,,,,,
c,"4.5 stars This has to be one of the most sick and twisted books I have ever read...I LOVED every moment! I’m going to keep this short because I don’t want to give anything away. A cat and mouse game ensues between a detective and serial killer when the killer gifts the detective with his diary, which tells the story of his extremely disturbing childhood. The voice of the serial killer jumps off the page and lures the reader into his deranged world. The Fourth Monkey moves at a fast pace. There's a lot of detailed gory scenes which made me cringe, but there’s some humor mixed in to ease the tension. The last page left me wanting more. I highly recommend! I received a copy of this book from NetGalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.",,,,,,

c,"A personal story of endometriosis pain mixed in with the meta-tale of how female pain has always been undervalued by a (male-dominated) medical profession. Both parts are interesting, but her writing really shines when she describes the raw sensations in her body as well as her ongoing process of dealing with the fallout. Recommended.",,,,,,
c,"Ms Norman weaves her personal experiences living with the diagnosis of endometriosis, and the history of women being ignored by medicine. It's a painfully brutal look at the ways women's health is misunderstood, insufficiently researched, poorly managed, and frequently misdiagnosed as being all in our heads. I'm reminded of the sobering statistics around adverse childhood events, or ACEs, and that it is typical of a woman with a chronic health issue to spend a minimum of three years seeking a diagnosis.",,,,,,

c,"This review is written by Bob Boze on behalf of Truth About Books. I’m always pleased to give a good review: Especially when it comes on the heels of two, not so good, reviews. In this case, my review rating is not good; it’s absolutely outstanding. If I could, I’d give Everything We Keep a 7 out of 5 rating. 5 for being very good, 6 for outstanding writing and, 7 because it’s the authors first book. Yes, not only am I in love with this book, I’ve added it to my top three books list. Aimee Tierney is madly in love with her childhood sweetheart, James. They grew up together, he protected her at every turn and they became engaged. Just before the wedding, James must go on a business trip to Mexico. A trip that only his body returns from. So, instead of saying their vows, Aimee ends up burying James on their planned wedding day. Devastated, Aimee spends over a year refusing to accept James death and move on with her life. Adding to this are the strange messages from a physic telling her that James is not dead. Pushed by her friends to at least start working on a life without James, she opens a specialty café. They also drag her kicking and screaming back into life beyond her home and the café. Here, she meets Ian, a photographer that she immediately develops feelings for. Feelings that are certainly mirrored by Ian. But the feelings and messages that James is not dead, persist. Feelings and verification of his death that she must resolve if she is ever to move on. So, two years after his purported death, Ian joins her, as she travels to Mexico to find her fiancée, who she is now certain is not dead. As she and Ian search for James, and the truth; secrets from their past and James’ family surface, along with her feelings for Ian and realization of what her life with James was really like. Everything We Keep not only has a unique plot, it is full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing, especially toward the end as she and Ian seek the truth in Mexico. It is also exceptionally well written with little to no errors (I think I found one), wonderful character development and an author who has mastered show, don’t tell. An excellent novel that kept me up until 2:30 AM to find out how it ends. By the way, several people with bad reviews due to a lot of errors, poor editing and a love story with no mystery, must have read a different book than I did.",,,,,,
i,"Read an excerpt of this and honestly I’m not sold on it yet. But maybe it gets better during the second half? Re-reading this synopsis, this book sounds pretty similar to Three Dark Crowns. Not sure how I feel about that... After reading the blurb, all I can say is... I am so ready!",,,,,,
c,"I did not like this book at all. It was creepy.
",,,,,,
c,"What an enjoyable story! A few plot twists I didn't see coming and an ending you won't forget. Well developed secondary characters make me want to read their stories too. I give it 4 stars out of 5 because the women are potty-mouths and the number of f-bombs increased as the story moved forward. By the last few chapters I was tired of it and wondered why this gifted author couldn't be more imaginative with their speech. That's really my only complaint, and anyone sensitive about this issue may wish to know before reading.",,,,,,
i,"Filthy, trashy book. I read only a few chapters and deleted it off of my kindle. If you like filth it would be for you. To bad I didn't know it was that kind of book before I bought it for my kindle.",,,,,,
c,"It reads like a Buzzfeed article, just list after list of things from the 80's, all held together by a flimsy nerd fantasy.",,,,,,
i,"Just two chapters left before I finish, and I will finish because it is a book club selection, based on its No. 1 ranking on Goodreads. Should have known better given the placement of Twilight on Goodreads' best fiction lists. Let me sum this up quickly: contrived, improbable, clichéd, with stereotypical characters portrayed without a trace of nuance, and reflective of the author's own biases.",,,,,,
i,"I'm about half-way through this book and I may not even bother finishing it. I also grew up a nerd in the 80s and I know nearly every reference in this book. But I find it tedious, boring and poorly written. The characters are one-dimensional, the info-dumping is simply excessive and who does he think needs all that info-dumping anyway? Who does the author imagine his audience is? For those of us who are nerds and geeks, we need no explanation. I would have enjoyed discovering the references without having each one pointed out to me. And if he writes ""80s style "" one more time I'm going to scream. WE KNOW ITS 80s STYLE! Just describe whatever it is and we will figure it out for ourselves. Burnt orange carpeting? Check. Wood paneling? Check. Big hair. Sure. We get it. Yawn. Neal Stephenson and Felicia Day (yes, even their early stuff) are light years ahead of what's in here. Read Snowcrash or go watch ""Do You Wanna Date my Avatar"" or ""I'm the One That's Cool"" on YouTube. I am honestly surprised at how much good press this novel got. I cannot recommend that anybody read it.",,,,,,
c,"The book begins with no preamble. We're introduced to detective Sam Porter, who gets a 911 text from one of his colleagues who tells him there's been an accident and that he should head to the site ASAP. The story unfolds and we quickly find out why Porter specifically was called to the scene. The dead man appears to be the Four Monkey Killer, a Chicago serial killer that Detective Porter has been tussling with for years. The man is holding a box with a piece of his most recent victim in it; it appears he was on the way to the mailbox when the bus came. He also has a journal in his pocket, which gives the reader a glimpse into the mind of the killer via a vignette from his childhood. The book cycles back and forth between the journal and present day. Sometimes, I find myself getting bored when the story skips around, but both stories were completely captivating so I was hooked. 4MK is truly twisted- we find out that he learned the tricks of the trade from his mother and father. We also get to find out where the nickname Four Monkey Killer comes from, which I loved. Despite the bus, 4MK has left clues to direct the police to his latest victim and they're frantically trying to 'puzzle it out' so they can reach the girl in time. There were some cliches peppered into the beginning- the corrupt Chicago politicians, the hard boiled - crap at technology police officers- but not enough to take away from the story. The story also has alternating POVs- Porter, 4MK via the journal, another detective, and the victim. As you might imagine, the book is about a kidnapping and a serial killer, so it does get graphic and violent. Reading through the victim's story was chilling, but her story is only a small piece of the puzzle. I kept thinking it was going to go one way and then it would go another. There were a few big surprises peppered throughout- none of which i saw coming. (But, to be fair, I'm pretty bad at predicting that sort of thing). It started a bit slower for me, but once I was about 60% of the way through I couldn't put it down. The fact that the story opens with a bus having run over a major player in the story kept things from becoming too predictable. Some of the pieces of the story were far fetched, but if you let yourself suspend reality and go with the narration, I think you'll enjoy it too. Favorite Quote: ""Women were perfectly capable of handling pain but not emotion. Men handled emotion but not pain. The differences were sometimes subtle, but they were there nonetheless.""",,,,,,
i,?my copy arrived! Is so beautiful??.?can’t wait to start reading it!.!.!.!,,,,,,
c,"The Great Alone was the most depressing novel I have read. The two main families suffered one tragedy after another. As I read over 20 of Kristin Hannah's books and enjoyed each, I pre-ordered The Great Alone. I kept reading all 438 pages thinking there must be a happy ending. Please Kristin Hannah bring back your old story telling that I loved.
But I can't recommend this book to anyone unless you have Move to Alaska on your Bucket List, then by all means read this book first. But keep in mind it takes place in the late seventies.",,,,,,
c,"Having spent some time in the harsh but beautiful state of Alaska, I can relate to the title and heart of this story. Just like Alaska, the author reveals the raw and dark sides of our nature that society often would rather attribute to criminal tendencies. In truth, any of us could be shocked at our actions if pushed far enough. There is a strong place in each of us that we draw from to do whatever it takes to survive and protect those we love. Alaska tests you and that place.. The author writes about that struggle beautifully and reveals the strengths both the male and female characters find within. While tender and heart-wrenching, the story unravels amid the spectacular beauty of ""the last frontier"".",,,,,,
c,This book keep me glued as the story unfolded. I never would have guessed how it would unveil not how it ended. Very interesting read. It was my first book with this author and I would look for others from her.,,,,,,
i,"Don't mind me, just freaking tf out over having this glorious retelling <3 <3 <3",,,,,,
i,"I couldn't go past the first chapter and neither will you. Regardless of how nerdy you might be, you won't like it either. I much rather read a phone book at least the characters are real in it. Kudos to the writer who somehow managed to hack Amazon by spamming it with the largest amount of fake 5 star reviews I have ever seen, now, that is what I call an great accomplishment, the book is not.",,,,,,
c,"I confess the book didn't grab me right away. I'm not sure why. However, I found myself drawn back to it. Starting to read it again, I found myself sucked in immediately. As the plot thickened, and the unanswered questions increased, I found myself caught up without putting the book down. Pausing only to eat, I finished the book that day. I learned about I subject that I want to learn more about, a certain form of dissociative identity disorder. How much more interesting to learn about something by reading it in a well written, spellbinding book. I recommend this book to all adults who love a complicated love story, coupled with possibly new psychological data.",,,,,,
i,"I really wanted to like this book, and eagerly looked forward to it after Everything You Never Told Me, which I thought was brilliant. What happened? Is this the same author? First, this book should be categorized as young adult, with all its high school drama. I kept waiting for something significant to happen, and finally gave up after a ridiculous, unrealistic scene where Izzy, trying to sabotage the teacher who caused her suspension, manages to jam the locks on all the classroom doors in the school, causing chaos in the halls and everywhere. The one person who suffered for this asinine 'trick' was the poor custodian, who ended up going lock by lock trying to un-jam the damage.Was this supposed to be amusing? It's a shame that Ng didn't come close to the brilliance of her first book. A definite adolescent mentality here. Pitiful.",,,,,,
c,"While I'm not a literature critic (whatever that is), I know Ms. Hannah is a great fiction writer. I have read most of her books and enjoyed most. I wish I hadn't read this one because it assaults the reader with one harsh human trial after another. To name a few, we have a very abusive husband/father, Alaskan winter survival with brutal isolation, poverty, extreme survivalists' mentality, filthy living conditions, and unrealistic random situations. Throw in cancer, severe accidents requiring extended rehab, lost love, etc. The last few pages provide us with somewhat of a ""happy ending"" as a reward for plowing through all the misery that preceded it. Oh joy!",,,,,,
c,"I'm not really sure what to make of this book. Overall, it kept me interested until the end, but in a ""it's a car wreck"" sort of way. The plot was fascinating until it turned weird. The execution and character development was quirky. The characters never fully formed in my mind as it seemed the author did too much telling and not a lot of showing. But, then, there were moments that I fully connected with them, mostly in Aimee's flashbacks to her childhood and early relationship with James. The sense of loss that I should have felt the entire book was only present in those times. More importantly, I never felt a connection between the characters. Beyond the plot and settings, this was the most important aspect of the book that kept it from being great.",,,,,,
c,"I wanted to like this book, but I just didn't. Admittedly, I cannot put myself in the shoes of the mother but the development of her character did not help me. Because it was written from the viewpoint of a 14-year-old girl, I sometimes felt Hannah wanted to write a young adult book but for some reason didn't. Good description of wilderness Alaska and what it would have taken to survive.",,,,,,
i,"It's rare that I don't give a book a fighting chance. Sometimes they just need time to get going... but I refuse to read a book that, granted is about teenagers, but feels like its written by a teenager! No thanks.",,,,,,
c,"This is a romance novel. Fans of literary fiction will be enormously disappointed as I was. Amazon needs to do a better job of differentiating chick lit from real literature. The prose is simultaneously mundane and overwrought. The fantastically good looking male love interests all smelled like cinnamon and sandalwood. The main character was so stereotypical that I could anticipate every single plot move. She was always cocking an eyebrow or engaging in some sort of dramatic meltdown including projectile vomiting, panic attacks, weak kneed wooziness from the approach of a good looking man. I read the whole thing hoping it would get better. It did not. This is fine for people who like this sort of thing but anyone interested in a good thoughtful novel will find it difficult to press through to the end.",,,,,,

c,"Thankfully I finished this book in just a few hours and didn't sacrifice too many hours of my life reading this ridiculous story. It was so unbelievable on so many levels and the protagonist was just a one dimensional wet towel. The only potentially interesting character was the new love interest and he became just stupid, putting his life on hold waiting for Aimee to come around. Skip this. There have to be better summer reads out there.",,,,,,
c,I won't write a long review as this book doesn't deserve more of my time than it's already received. It's flat; it's predictable; it's filled with unlikable characters; it's clunky in it's writing style. It is a great book to read before you hit the sack as you'll be lulled to snoozeland quickly. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.,,,,,,
i,That is one of the worst books I've ever read. First off way too much tragedy to be believeable....and 2nd the hot and cold routine got old real quick. Just skimmed the last several chapters to get done,,,,,,
c,"I was looking for something light, a summer read. This book is just fluff, a romance between our heroine and two men, plodding through an obvious storyline to its inevitable conclusion. I don't think I have the vaguest mental picture of the main character, Aimee, and most of the rest of the cast were caricatures. What's clear, and the only reason to keep reading was that the author was trying to make the book better, and there were occasional flashes of nuance and talent that peeked out from behind the heavy scaffolding of the plot. Near the end, the author used the word ""extrapolated"" when she meant ""extricated"" -- perhaps the editor was bored, too.",,,,,,
c,"I am astounded at the high ratings of this book. It is so poorly written! It didn't ease into the flashbacks, and the plot twists are barely there. The language was clumsy and uneven and the characters were completely undeveloped. It was hard to buy the storyline, and, like a few other reviewers stated, I couldn't get past the details. I didn't understand the whole coffee thing. It felt phony, contrived, and untrue. I'm not a coffee aficiando, but if I were to write a story about a woman who apparently has magical powers with coffee, I'd do the research and make sure my language was correct. And why didn't her parents help out at her restaurant when she left for Mexico? And why did the author spend so much time in the beginning telling us how great Aimee is at baking bread, only to never have her baking bread again? And who orders a vanilla latte with hazelnut? Wouldn't that just be a vanilla-hazelnut latte? And why am I nitpicking these details? Because I can't get past them! And why would Ian, a world-renowned photographer, work as a barista in a cafe? Why would it take 19 hours to fly to Mexico? I have about 60 pages of the book left, and I'm going to skim and finish, but I was profoundly disappointed in this. Like many have noted, the premise is genius. But the poor writing really brings this down.",,,,,,
c,"Couldn’t get into this book at all. So much hype and it was just blah. I really wanted to like it.
",,,,,,
c,"I finished this book but I should have put it down after reading a couple chapters. I thought maybe it would get better but it never did. In addition, I did not enjoy the writing style at all. I guess some people might say it has plot twists but there were just a bunch of different plots thrown in to one story- none of them very well developed. Overall, I just found the story to be bizarre.",,,,,,
c,"I got this book through an online book subscription service. I was really excited to read this after learning of the premise. Once I started the book, it didn't take long for me to realize that this was going to be one of those simplistic, unconvincing, one-dimensional piles of rubbish (exactly like something you'd find at the airport). I held out and finished it, but every ""twist"" was so predictable it made for a mind-numbing and discouraging journey. Of COURSE dad dies. Of COURSE girl gets pregnant on the first go. Of COURSE the two literally get away with murder and then the girl gets let go after making a full confession. And OF COURSE boy wakes from his skull-crush coma to live happily ever after with the prodigal daughter.",,,,,,
c,"A vapid, juvenile waste of time.",,,,,,
i,This book is so bad I could not even finish it. It became a long drawn out storyline. In this storyline not one of the characters was enduring to me. I honestly cared nothing for any of them and about the time the author started hinting medical memory loss I just gave up and stopped reading the book. I feel the writing in this book was very superficial and childish. I would not recommend to anyone to read.,,,,,,
c,"The book moved slow, with too much time spent on boring details and not enough on the ""mystery"". Plots ""twists"" were very predictable. The writing and prose seemed a young adult level. I had to really work to finish this book. Could have been interesting, but overall I would not recommend to anyone.",,,,,,
c,"Although i liked the story, it wasn’t the most compelling i have read, but there is one outstanding problem that i am surprised the author did not research. Surrogacy is illegal in the state of New York. This is a huge oversight and consideriing she had quite a big staff to help her, one would have thought that someone would have realized that the plot needed to be moved to a neighboring state in order for it to be plausible.

c,"An completely unbelievable storyline written in a repetatively frustrating style that I've never read from any other. I put it down due to boredom about 1/3 of the way through and only for the fact that I bought this book, did I pick it up and finish it. It was a waste of good money and I would NOT recommend this book to anyone.",,,,,,
c,"I loved The Nightingale. I adore The Great Alone: A Novel. This story will tear at your heartstrings and move you to tears as it compels you to read each next chapter. With characters so well fleshed out and visually described, one feels a part of this far away world of life in Alaska. I just want to talk about it to others who’ve read it. Leni is a heroine who overcomes tragedy and pain and triumphs with strength and resolve. Also, while a sad commentary on the justice system regarding battered and abused women, the novel’s outcome proves that sometimes one’s sheer determination along with the fortifying love and commitment of those around her triumphs over all adversity. Truly, truly, a must read.",,,,,,
i,"Let me save you the trouble. This book is AWFUL. The writing style is absolutely painful....imagine Twilight fanfiction. No, not Fifty Shades of Grey, the stuff that DIDN'T get published. I was able to finish Fifty Shades, but I had to quit this book a little over halfway through. That should give you a solid idea of just how awful this book is.",,,,,,
c,I can't believe anyone would give this book a 5 star rating!!! This book is NOT fine literature! It's like the cheap romance novels I read as a teenager! I learned nothing about human emotions or anything else reading this book! I skipped pages so I could get to the end as I do not leave any book unfinished. Spend your time reading something more substantial! This book is pure fluff!,,,,,,
c,"Nope nope nope nope nope. Seriously? Se7en meets Silence of the Lambs? How about, this author wishes he had half of Thomas Harris' talent to write a solid cat-and-mouse thriller? This book read very much as a paint-by-numbers thriller, or something where someone pulled Thriller Plot #3 (copyright and patent pending) and just filled in the names. There's the deadly serious cop that's been chasing the serial killer for years. There's his wisecracking partner. There's the sassy female cop that has some slight sexual tension for the wisecracker, and nothing but sympathy for the lead. There's the bullish sergeant. There's the standard false leads (that broadcast their falseness far too loudly) and the inevitable puzzle pieces that the killer leaves to lead the cops on a merry chase. There's also the diary that details the ridiculous and patently stupid early childhood of the 4MK killer, who's father sounds like Beaver Cleaver's father from the late 50s/early 60s, even though it must have taken place in the late 90s, early 2000s. It just felt as though the whole damn thing was crafted for maximum public appeal, and a nice bidding war for television or movies...apparently all of which it achieved. So much bullshit. Yeah, don't expect a review from me for the next book. I'm stating here and now that I'm totally bailing on this ridiculous series. What crap. I'll go back and read Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs before I'll wade into this particular cesspool again. ",,,,,,
c,"This was a fast paced mystery/thriller with plenty of great plot twists and turns. There are many elements of a police procedural incorporated into the story, which made it even more interesting in my opinion. The writing is excellent and the story line is tight. There is a feeling of racing against a deadline that made it hard to put the book down. Definitely a page turner! Highly recommended if you like thrillers and you like mysteries.",,,,,,
i,"It's rare I don't finish a book, but I dropped READY PLAYER ONE midway through and never looked back. I was shocked that such a highly-recommended book had such shoddy prose, non-existent characters, and dull pacing. Its attempts to evoke 80s nostalgia read like flat referencing of things the writer pulled from a reference work; they aren't evocative in the least. If it was meant to read like a bad mashup of much better works, well, Cline succeeded at that, at least. I should have taken the hint when, halfway through the first chapter, the writer inserts one of those evangelizing enviro-atheist rants that have no plot purpose and seem to breed in works of bad fiction. (Never understood the point of hardcore evangelical atheism to start with. However, when you're trying to get people to pay you for something, it's probably best to keep your freaky religious natterings to yourself if they have nothing to do with the plot.) Never the less, I slogged on, and wasted another hour of my life on a book that never got any better. Don't make the same mistake. Avoid, avoid, avoid.",,,,,,
c,"What a horrible, violent, gory, frustrating, hopeless book. At the end I was reading a sentence a page just to get it over with. Don’t read this book.",,,,,,
i,"Finished two chapters and just couldn't go on. The plot was absurd. It was SO heavily preachy from the get go. I'm not opposed to social commentary, but I'd at least like it to be nuanced and woven into the story, not thrown in your face in Chapter 1. Instead, it just came across as whining. It made me cringe. In all the science fiction and fantasy books I've ever read, this is the only one I couldn't finish. Maybe the movie won't suck, but I'm not terribly optimistic.",,,,,,

i,"I received this book for free (Kindle First) and I paid too much. I stopped reading around 85% through because I honestly could care less where the book was going. The actions of the main character made no sense for the first 50% of the book, then when it actually started (it takes about 50% for anything to happen), it had a number of unbelievable turns that didn't make any sense and pretty much drained my energy to finish the book. Normally when a book is slow (so slow) at the beginning there are subtle clues being planted for future reveals so that as a reader you are rewarded for trudging through the early parts. None of this happens here. The book could have started at the 50% mark and been a short (and still uninteresting) mystery novel. Instead it was some half (poor) romance story with an equally poor mystery slapped on the end. My suggestion for people contemplating actually paying for this book do this: If you are in the mood for a romance there are far better ones out there, if you want a mystery, there are far better ones out there. If you want both, again, look elsewhere.",,,,,,
c,Really shocked at all the good reviews for this book. The writing was sophomoric & the story line was ridiculous. I forced myself to finish it but I should have just let sleeping dogs lie. Makes me wonder if a ton of the reviews on this site are phony. This book is just plain bad.,,,,,,
i,I'm near the end of the book and I'm missing pages 329 - 360. It's filled with pages 25 - 56 all over again.,,,,,,

i,"I wanted to like this book, but I just didn't. Admittedly, I cannot put myself in the shoes of the mother but the development of her character did not help me. Because it was written from the viewpoint of a 14-year-old girl, I sometimes felt Hannah wanted to write a young adult book but for some reason didn't. Good description of wilderness Alaska and what it would have taken to survive.",,,,,,
i,"I really wanted to love this book...I guess because I love Alaska & stories about strong women...and also the reviews sounded so promising. But UGH...it was about constant struggle...which BTW Alaska is NOT all about just struggle!! I felt I gave it a good chance, but I only got through 60% of it and I could NOT go on. It was long, tedious, monotonous, emotionally draining and disturbing on many levels...the abuse, the alcoholism, the barricading, the constant struggle...it was just plain DEPRESSING to me. I found myself anxious and agitated and just wishing the bad stuff would END and something good would happen! I couldn’t even read far enough to see if it actually did. I can’t yet put into words all of how it made me feel...but none of it is good! All I know for sure is I had to STOP...",,,,,,
c,It was horrible.,,,,,,
i,"I'm only about 16% through the book, but I'm guessing the writing isn't going to get any better. I've rolled my eyes a few times already. Aimee buries her fiancee, James, on what was supposed to be their wedding day, but 5 months later she's hot for some stranger and starts dating him. It's middle of July as I write this, so that would be the same amount of time as from here back to middle of February. Not that long ago was it?
But my favorite sentence ,( it really gave me a laugh at least) comes as she is contemplating her new cafe she wants to buy and open. She says, ""Aimee's Cafe. James had suggested the name."" Cracks me up. It's a good thing she had James to brainstorm with while trying to come up with a name!
I'm going to skim through the rest of it just to see if my presumptions are right about what's really going on with poor James. But I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.",,,,,,

c,"I read this book for the first time in the 8th grade. I had to get my mom to sign a permission slip because of the cursing. Before I began reading, I had so many expectations. Back then, I read Seventeen Magazine, and back then, Seventeen Magazine ran brainy features about books and poetry. There was one feature where they asked people what book changed their lives, and something like more than half said Catcher in the Rye. I think there might have been some celebrity comments in there, too. At any rate, it was a ringing endorsement. So you can imagine my disappointment when I hated it. Not only did I hate Holden, but I hated everything about the novel. There was nothing I enjoyed. I did my book report where I confessed my hatred (which led my teacher to confess that she did, too), but I couldn't let it go. I honestly felt that my loathing of a novel that so many others found ""life-changing"" indicated some deep and horrible flaw. I felt like hating Catcher in the Rye was my dirty little secret. Time passed, and my self-loathing mellowed. I began to think that perhaps I'd come at it too young, so after my first year of college, I decided to re-read it, go at it with fresh eyes, and see if my opinion had changed. Here's the thing: it hasn't. I get it. I get that Holden is supposed to be loathsome. I get that he is the hypocrite he hates. I get that almost all teenagers go through the kind of thinking he experiences. I get it. I do. I just don't like it. Oh, and I'm not ashamed anymore. ",,,,,,
c,"I am baffled by the positive reviews, as I wish I had not wasted my time reading this shallow book full of cliches. I stuck with it, hoping it would get better, but it just got worse with every chapter. It read as though it was written by a teen for middle-schoolers, validating the stereotypical adolesvent worldview: Artists and unwed mothers are good, the upper middle class is evil.... Don't waste your time reading this!",,,,,,
i,DNF. Asshole narrator does not make for a good story.,,,,,,
c,This book wasn't awful but it wasn't necessarily 'good' I found some parts interesting and some parts extremely boring. But it doesn't deserve a 2 star rating and it doesn't deserve a 4 star rating. Its just an eh book. Thats all I can say about it.,,,,,,
c,3.5 stars I think. The rating doesn't even really matter. All I can think about is what a strange reading experience this was. I wanna know how Holden's story continues!,,,,,,
c,"My theory as to this book's unusually polarizing nature: either you identify with Holden Caulfield or you don't. Those who see themselves (either as they were or, God help them, as they are) in Holden see a misunderstood warrior-poet, fighting the good fight against a hypocritical and unfeeling world; they see in Salinger a genius because he gets it, and he gets them. Those of us who don't relate to Holden see in him a self-absorbed whiner, and in Salinger, a one-trick-pony who lucked into performing his trick at a time when some large fraction of America happened to be in the right collective frame of mind to perceive this boring twaddle as subversive and meaningful. ",,,,,,
c,This book is awful. It feels like a cross between bad fanfic and a wikipedia entry. The only redeeming factor is listening to it on audiobook is hilariously bad and I wish RiffTrax did commentary on audiobooks.,,,,,,

c,"If I could give this book a zero, I would. I absolutely hated it. Generally, I don't hate books, either. Usually it's a very strong dislike, and generally, I give them a second chance. But no, I will never be reading this book again. In my opinion, Holden is the worst character in the English language. Salinger tried just too damn hard to make him 'universal', to the point where he becomes unrealistic. His train of thought is annoying and repetitive, and God, those catchphrases of his. Can someone shut this kid up? Holden is almost the anti-Gary Stu. Nearly every thing's wrong with him. The one good thing about him being his love for his younger sister.  The plot is one of the worst I've ever read. It's boring, and it, like Holden, is unbelievably and painfully repetitive. Holden calls up an old friend, has a drink. Holden calls up a girl, has a drink. Holden dances with a girl. Then he drinks. Was there a climax to this book? I must have missed it. Maybe it was Holden nearly freezing to death (um, what?) in Central Park? No, no, maybe it was when Holden called up that hooker! Maybe not. The plot is so fuzzy and flat I couldn't tell when to peak my interest. And that's just it, it never did. So buh-bye, Holden! Your book's been gathering dust on my shelf for the past two years and it'll stay that way. Until I decide to sell it, of course.",,,,,,
c,"A solid thriller, with an intriguing dynamic between the lead investigator and the killer. Beware of evil hiding under the appearance of normality. Thanks to Net Galley and to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt for offering me an ARC copy of this book that I freely chose to review. This novel ticks many of the boxes of successful thrillers: interesting and gruesome crimes (and a pretty bizarre serial killer), police procedural elements (and an investigating team easy to connect with and amusing at times), tension ticking (a girl has been taken by the 4MK [Four Monkey Killer] and she must be found before she dies), twists and turns (I suspect most avid readers of thrillers will guess some, at least, of them), red herrings… It is fairly long, although it keeps a good pace. If I missed anything, it was perhaps more psychological insight. And if we stop to think about it, the police force seems pretty ineffective but… The story is told in chapters written in the third person from different points of view, mostly Porter’s (the lead investigator in the case although not fully back to work after some time off. We learn the reason later in the book) and Emory’s (the young victim), although there is the odd chapter from one of the other detective’s points of view, Clair. Interspersed with this we have fragments of the killer’s diary, which is found in the pocket of a man killed by a bus at the beginning of the book. The diary, that starts out pretty harmless, as the account of what seems to be a pretty normal childhood, gets creepier and creepier as it goes along and it provides an understanding (or justification of sorts) for the killer’s later behaviour (blood is thicker and all that, but there are also lies, secrets and betrayals. That is, if we are to believe the diary).  That and other aspects of the book (and I don’t want to say much to avoid spoilers) including the cat-and-mouse chase, provide us with some interesting insights into the mind of the killer and emphasise the fact that appearances can be very deceptive. A seemingly normal middle-class family can hide all kinds of dirty secrets. And upper-class families can too, as becomes evident through the book. The revenge/avenging aspect of the murders (the sins of the fathers are visited…) is not new, although it makes the murderer more intriguing. The other parts of the book help move the story forward and the events are set chronologically, from the moment Porter is awakened by a phone call that brings him back to the police, as he’s been chasing the 4MK Killer for over five years. Although Porter’s point of view dominates the novel, I did not feel we got to know him all that well. Yes, something has happened to him (I guessed what it was early on) and he is suffering and unwilling to openly acknowledge that or discuss it; he is not keen on gadgets and seems utterly out of touch with new technologies and social media, and he is determined and driven, putting himself at risk repeatedly for the good of others. But, although I liked the fact that the team of detectives investigating the case were pretty normal individuals (not corrupt, not twisted and bitter, even when it would be more than justified, not morally ambiguous psychopaths), I still missed having more of a sense of who Porter really is. Clair has little page space and I got no sense of her own personality, other than knowing that she cares for Porter and her colleagues and she has an amusing love/dislike relationship with Nash (who is the character that provides the light relief throughout the book). In the case of Emory, who finds herself in a terrifying situation, we get to share her experiences with her, and it is one of the most effective portions of the book, adding to the tension and the need to keep turning the pages. The style of writing is direct, with only the necessary descriptions to allow us to follow the investigation (including descriptions of clues and places. I particularly enjoyed the idea of the tunnels from bootlegging times that help bring the setting’s history into the novel). The chronological storyline and the signposting of the different points of view, make it a story dynamic and easy to read, and although it is perhaps longer than the norm in the genre it is a fairly quick read. As I said, there are plenty of twists and turns, enough to keep one’s mind busy, although I suspect avid readers of the genre will guess a few of them, if not all. I have read some of the comments disparaging the fact that the police seem to be pretty ineffective and they only get to rescue the victim thanks to the clues left by the killer. Indeed, that is so (in fairness, Porter, who seems the most clued-on of the team and the expert on this case, is battling personal issues of his own and not at his best) but, if anything, that further emphasises the relationship between Porter and the killer. What attracts the killer to Porter? The ending (oh, yes, very satisfying, although, of course, it creates intrigue for the next book in the series) highlights that issue even more. I get the feeling that this series will improve as it goes along but only time will tell. In summary, a story of evil hiding in unexpected places, of secrets and lies that are covered by a thin veneer of normality, and a solid police procedural thriller, with a main character and a killer whose relationship holds the key to more mysteries to come.  Ah, a word of warning. If you don’t like graphic violence and torture, you might want to give it a miss.",,,,,,
c,I didn't like anything about the story.,,,,,,
i,DNF 56%,,,,,,
i,"the poor writing was a major turn-off. I liked The Nightingale, and approached this book with optimism because of it. More than once, I checked to be sure this was the same author. There's misery galore here, so as one reviewer stated, if this is your thing, you'll probably enjoy it. I understand that domestic abuse victims may stay in or return to those relationships despite all good advice, but these people were difficult to believe. Dialogue was stiff and contrived, love didn't seem real. The word 'Wow!' seemed to be the only way to express surprise. The word 'toxic' was used repeatedly to describe the parents' relationship. Really? Actions, behaviors can lead the reader to that conclusion; if you must use the word to tell the reader how it is, don't keep stating it. (This is where a good editor could've made a difference. I kept thinking I'd already read something, and in fact, the same statements were made throughout the book) I've never been to Alaska, but I had no sense of its beauty and majesty; instead, I read that the characters loved it, and met a cast of characters who surely must be extreme stereotypes of people who seek a free life in remote areas. I have less than 15 pages to go...and I really don't care what happens to anyone, since they are not believable. Disappointed. Waste of money.",,,,,,
c,"I’ll confess that when I first read this, I wasn’t quite sure what to make of it. I don’t always catch the analogies hidden beneath the surface or the social implications of what the book could be about. All I knew was this was on the classics list, I hadn’t read it, and it was one of the most banned books in history, based on language, violence, promiscuity, and the threat of encouraging moral decay. The book is about a young teenage boy named Holden who gets kicked out of many schools. It’s all about him and his rebellion at everything. It’s said that it’s an analogy for growing up. All I saw was a teenager who saw through a lot of people’s bullshit and walked away depressed because of it. He expressed himself as most teenagers of his time, granting Salinger a comment in excellence at his portrayal of a young boy’s angst. But other than that, I can’t say it moved me too much. ",,,,,,

i,After The Nightingale I was thrilled to get this book in the mail! I dug in right away and was enjoying the descriptions of homesteading so much that I didn’t pay as much attention to the domestic violence part. But that became the whole book and the focus went away from life in the Alaskan wilderness. Hannah is a very talented author but I am so disappointed at the twists and turns in the story! I am two thirds in but felt compelled to stop and warn readers that this should be marketed as a book more about spouse abuse than the Alaskan wilderness.,,,,,,
c,"Approximate re-telling of Shakespeare’s King Lear in the form of an adult fantasy with women in many of the central and supporting roles. The writing was elegant, with lush descriptions creating an atmospheric setting for this fantasy world. I could picture the jagged cliffs of this island country, the ships from faraway lands docking at port, and the majestic castles. It seemed like a story set in medieval times, with no invented creatures, where the island, trees, and wind are sentient. The magical elements were complex and fascinating. The characters were well-developed. The world and the plot were built very slowly, with most of the action saved until late in the book. Many back stories were interspersed throughout, flashing back various numbers of years into the past. These flashbacks, I felt, were unnecessary, as most of these topics had already been explained in the narrative. It was also a bit repetitive. For example, I didn’t need to be reminded many times over that one of the characters is a bastard or one of the sisters envisions herself a man. These inclusions made the book a bit lengthy, at just under 600 pages. The ending appears to setup a sequel, which may or may not appeal to you depending on whether you like series. I tend to enjoy stand-alone stories more. Themes include the value of balance in life, the dangers of obsession, the desire to be accepted for oneself, and the many facets of love. Key components of the plot involve madness, treachery, romance, political intrigue, power, control, and forgiveness. Overall, I enjoyed it, and I don’t think it is essential to know Shakespeare’s King Lear story to appreciate it. I would definitely read another book by this author. Recommended to readers of fantasy that don’t mind a non-linear timeline and a gradual build-up without a great deal of action. Contains language, not-overly-graphic sex, and violence.  I received a complete version of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in return for a candid review. I hope the final version includes a map. Memorable quotes: ""Ban had learned not to put off unpleasant tasks, for they tended to only become more unpleasant with the stall."" ""She was ready, if not to forgive, then to understand. And that was ever the first step."" ""For what was kindness, but offering comfort where none was owed?"" ""If it makes your world smaller, it isn't love.""",,,,,,
i,"Can't get going with this one. The author, through the narrator of the story, makes some definitive statements about human nature and our ecosystem that gave a certain sense of hubris. Just can't get into it enough to want to keep reading. Had high hopes given other reviews and a personal recommendation from a co-worker that said, ""You'll love it or hate it."". Well, hate is a strong word, and having not gotten through the first couple of chapters, all I can say is: I didn't like it very much.",,,,,,
c,"Finally read this for the first time! I'm so glad I did. I found Holden Caulfield, the main character, a very lost and confused boy. He's a walking contradiction. He views the entire world as a""phony"" and he seems like a misfit yet he doesn't hold himself to the standards that he holds the rest of the world. As for the story, I almost feel like there wasn't really a story? This book is made up of small events in his life. Like getting kicked out of school or his encounter with people but mostly Holden just wanders New York lost and finds himself in sticky situations. What I loved about the book is Holden's internal monologue. A lot of dry humor and sarcasm and I sort of liked that. It kept me interested enough. All in all, this book was character driven of a boy resisting adulthood.",,,,,,
c,"It's sad that a book that started out as exciting and promising and super engaging turned out to be the hardest to tolerate and finish. What happened? The story was super interesting, the characters seem smart, centered, admirable and about the last third of the book it started going downhill and crashed. It's so sad and frustrating. Why wasn't anyone advising this writer? Why does the writer do that to her characters? It's inconceivable. The h went from smart vivacious girl to a stupid insecure tease who claims to not like to play games when that's all she ends up doing. It's so cliche its just pathetic. The guy who is supposed to be all that a dream guy is turns out to be a softy who needs to grow some balls. Does the writer think that her scenes are sexy and a continuous turn on towards satisfaction? Well you're completely wrong, it's just annoying and I feel duped. Why do that to your story I cannot understand. So sad!",,,,,,
i,Bleh. DNF,,,,,,
c,"This book sucks so much. It wallows in nostalgia because it has absolutely nothing to say, and it's poorly written to boot. Don't buyt this garbage",,,,,,
c,"So, this novel was totally pointless. It had no plot, and it felt like J. D. Salinger had written every chapter without any forethought whatsoever, and let Holden do what he may. How about the whole Jane thing? Did Holden never call her because he was never in the mood to do so, or because Salinger wasn't in the mood to write any such scene? Holden himself, for all his posturing, was the biggest phony of the lot. Somehow, despite all the above (or perhaps because of it), I enjoyed this novel tremendously. It killed me. It really did. I still haven't figured out why, though. If I ever do, I will definitely tell you. ",,,,,,
c,If one removed all of the 80s references it'd be about 50 pages long. Mediocre at best and can't see the mass appeal. Ranks up there with The Martian in disappointing books. That one was a 300+ page word problem.,,,,,,
c,"I love this author and looked forward to this book for her storytelling. Her stories just grab you and draw you in as if you were experiencing the emotions and turmoils and ups and downs of the main characters. However, like other reviewers I found The Great Alone just too depressing. Don't get me wrong it was a good story, but there was less depth into each character and parts of it were just too unreal to be believable. Her other books, such as Winter Garden and Firefly Lane you really could relate to the growth and feelings of the characters even though they too had also difficult events to deal with they felt real. I can see why this book will become a movie. I wonder what that will be like.

c,Reading this book was one of the biggest wastes of my time in the past twenty years. Holden Caulfield's problem is that he is the biggest phony he knows. Count the number of times he lies or behaves like someone he's not and then try to convince me otherwise. This is not a book about teenage alienation. It's about a smart-ass who can't deal with who he really is and spends almost 300 pages ranting about it - most likely to a doctor in a psych ward.,,,,,,
i,"I’m always shocked by how many readers detest this book and its main charcter. I reread this book over & over when I was 14 & 15. Maybe it takes a self absorbed, unhappy and disaffected adolescent to appreciate and enjoy another such adolescent. However, what I took from Holden was that he was grieving for his beloved dead brother Allie (hey critical readers: feel some compassion for him!) and how much he loved his sister Phoebe. I liked the kid, a lot. I haven’t read this book since I graduated from high school and I do wonder how I’d feel about it as an adult, or as even an adolescent of today and not one from the sixties. Most of my reading friends loved this book too. Maybe it’s a sixties thing. Phoniness was a huge concern among the young back then, and I remember identifying with Holden and his angst. I don’t think I want to disturb my fond memories by rereading this as an adult so I’m going to keep my memories, I think. I do still have my old paperback copy so I might change my mind someday. ",,,,,,
c,The writing style was simplistic. Hard (manic) story to follow or believe. There wasn't enough depth for everything that was happening.,,,,,,

i,DNF.,,,,,,
c,A spell in the army would do that young man a power of good! Or maybe a couple of bags of heroin. Anything to stop that whining voice....,,,,,,
c,"I was actually pretty disappointed with this book. I do like classics and I, while reading this for school, hoped that I would be able to add this to my list of more enjoyed classic novels. Right when I started reading, I realized that that wouldn't happen. This story is told by Holden Caulfield, a 16 year old boy, who has just been expelled from yet another school. Catcher in the Rye is mainly Holden's thoughts which usually involve either sex, someone being phony, or how he hates things that people do. His behavior and actions were often contradictory which became annoying even though they were a part of his character. There are rare occasions that he does show sincerity or kindness, but not often enough. His mood swings and actions were, to me, very annoying and not like any teenager I know, despite readers saying this is relate-able. I struggled to read this, not because it was boring but because of Holden's personality and the way he talks. The ending was also a let down because I thought that there would be a better ending. I don't think that him just deciding to stop telling the story really counts as a good ending even though it would be how Holden would act. Overall, I was disappointed with this book mainly because of Holden and his behavior. ",,,,,,
c,"The hype around this book is truly baffling. It's a plotty, accessible best seller- fine. But the characters are insufferable. I can see where the author was trying to make them complex, but she never took them out of their (artist / jock / nice rich housewife / angsty teen) stereotypes, so it's just transparent and strained. What really got me though is the ad nauseam explanation of every. single. little. tiny. thing, every reason for every character making every decision. Annoying but mostly boring.",,,,,,
i,"Way too much crap to bear! DNF, even though I try never to leave books around, especially classics :/",,,,,,
c,"I know there are people who thought this book changed their lives and helped them find their unique way in the world, but coming from a non-white, non-middleclass background, as a kid, I really resented having to read about this spoiled, screwed up, white, rich kid who kept getting chance after chance and just kept blowing it because he was so self-absorbed and self-pitying. I felt at the time there was no redeeming value in it for me. I was born on the outside trying my best to get in. I felt no sympathy for him at all. I didn't even find him funny. It just made me angry. I guess it still does.",,,,,,
c,This book makes me want to cry like a baby. I am so in love with J. D. Salinger's writing style. ,,,,,,
c,"This book has a great idea and some interesting possibilities, but it's written like the fantasy novel of a bored teen.",,,,,,
i,Nothing happens in this book but at the same time so much goes on in Holden's mind. DNF at p. 48. This never happened. It's official. My taste has changed.,,,,,,
c,"I'm going to chalk this up to not understanding the times in which this was written, but ""arrogant self-righteous teen who thinks the world is phony while lying to himself and everyone else"" doesn't strike me as terribly interesting, nor worthwhile. ",,,,,,
i,Sorry but cannot give this book a good review as it is quiet childish. Maybe it should be for a younger audience as I could understand teenagers relating to it. I only read a couple of chapters as this was not my type of book.,,,,,,
i,"This was the most boring, pointless book I have listened to in a long time. I gave it 3 hours before turning it off because I could not listen to it any longer. Three hours where literally nothing happened. I guess for some people this was a great read, but for me it was a waste.
",,,,,,
c,"At best, this is a book aimed at the age 13 to 14 set. This is definitely not geared for an adult. It's relatively predictable and based on a teen romance.",,,,,,
c,The actual writing is excellent and captures the voice of an idiot teen well. It's just not a voice I am in any way interested in.,,,,,,
c,"YET another book that I am giving 3.5 out of 5 because it seems like the most fitting rating; I didn't enjoy this book enough to give it four stars, but I think it deserves more than three so here we are. I'm gonna take a bit of time to formulate a proper review so stay tuned.",,,,,,
c,"Absolutely terrible. The stereotypes made my brain bleed. This reads like a YA fantasy for teens. Scratch that. Reading this was like cracking open a teenager's diary. Waaaaaaaaaa! So much teenage angst. The good parent is ""mean"" and the bad parent ""nice"". Such a tired and old teen fantasy. Boring...",,,,,,
i,"I don't have enough patience for whiny teens right now, sorry Holden.",,,,,,
c,"Okay if you like 70s D&D and Rush and 80s video games and pop culture, this book is your crack. This is a really good book! I don't know if I can give a 100% spoiler free review so read at your own risk: there is a huge puzzle in a virtual reality world with the whole world as the prize, and to crack the code the people and corporations of the future are immersing themselves in the singular creator's passions, which are all completely retro - Dungeons and Dragons, Trash 80 text only games, 80s movies, etc. I liked the CHARACTERS even if they were broadly drawn. I liked the bad guys, they always surprised me with how evil they could get while very much resembling the constantly-excused corporate overlords of today. The near future world of energy crisis and indentured servitude to corporations for unpaid debts was one of my favorite parts of the book. And while you're reading, it'll all fly by and you'll love every word. Until after the book. The biggest problem I have is this massive puzzle, built by a genius, which took five years to get a crack in the armor, then devolved into a fairly 'easy' scavenger hunt. I guessed at the first clue for the first key before the main character did. I like books where I am amazed at how smart the author is and he's always 10 steps ahead of me, but I didn't feel like that with the puzzle aspect of this book. That is a quibble, nitpicking for sure, because the experience of reading was great. 4 stars.",,,,,,
c,I would rather light myself on fire than read another sentence of that again.,,,,,,
c,"By now everyone knows the basic plot and, as if the author thought we might forget, there’s a mini summary at the end in the form of a newspaper article written by ale I, the young girl threw whose eyes and thoughts the story unfolds. For me, the problem began when the story jumped fours years ahead and Lenient became a young woman. Does she follow in the heartbreaking footsteps of her mama? Does she protect her mama and herself or does her mother finally protect her child? Do we want the romantic fairy tale ending or heartbreak? Do the women survive or does Alaska, the Great Alone, break everyone? Does the remnant of Vietnam living inside Ernt, Leno’s father, crawl out and overwhelm Leni and Cora? Are they survivors and at what cost? I feel like Hannah couldn’t definitively decide, either. I felt her wavering in the ending that seemed like it would never come and when it did, it was a little too sad, a little too satisfying.",,,,,,
i,DNF. Got 20% through and it didn't hold my interest.,,,,,,
c,Pivotal novel. A must for anyone whose ever felt alienation or all those lovely teenager feelings.,,,,,,
c,"I dislike everything about this book. I dislike the protagonist, the plot, the writing style, the setting of the novel, the other characters, the pretentiousness of it all. The only redeeming thing about reading this book was that it ended so soon, that it wasn't lengthy at all. [(And also the last chapter with his sister. That was too pure to be a part of this book.)",,,,,,
i,I wanted to like this so much. I tried but I can't get into it yet for some reasons. DNF at 56%,,,,,,
c,"This is a very moody, morose story of a young woman rootless with grief and her best friend's efforts to reach her.I liked it but there is no real feel good here. The story switches back and forth in time. There is a dark sweetness to the relationship and the kinship ties with the family. Super depressing which never really let up.",,,,,,
c,"Meh. Interesting plot, sometimes a hard stretch. Dialogue between characters was just cliche at worst and boring at best. Not as clever as I had hoped.",,,,,,
c,"Here's how it goes: Character gets in a tight spot that is pop-culture themed. Author realizes they painted the hero into a corner. Deus ex machina solution. Every. Single. Time. Every. Single. Conflict. It's really unsatisfying to read something where its not the hero's actions but a lucky lightning strike on a clear summer day that wins everything.

i,"This is a very unrealistic book, which made it hard to finish. If I’m being honest, I skipped around the entire thing. This is why I don’t trust reviews.",,,,,,
c,"So awful in every single way. There were few parts in which I enjoyed or thought were tolerable. Other than that, this book makes me want to kill myself by paper cuts",,,,,,
i,"I don’t even know if I can finish this book and that’s saying a lot for someone who never “cries uncle”. I can’t believe the same person who wrote Winter Garden and The Nightengale even wrote this. The writing is juvenile, simplistic and redundant and the characters are absolutely flat....no dimension at all. I simply do tnot understand all the rave reviews ???????????????",,,,,,
c,"I enjoyed the ride. But apparently not for the same reason as everyone. I loved the hero. He was an unusual guy but really funny. He made me laugh out loud more than once. However I didn't find him as smart as everyone seems to. He was a lot of things: sensitive, lost, realist .I loved getting inside his mind and found his way of seeing things really interesting .still, using the world ""depressive"" in every paragraph and for every situation doesn't make anyone smart. I didn't like much the end, or the lack of one. I was at least expecting someone to die lol. Maybe I would had enjoyed this book more when I was 16 .I will never know.",,,,,,
i,"DNF at page 60. To quote Christina of PolandBananasBOOKS, ""Whiny teenager is annoying."" Really repetitive. Not worth my time when I'm sick. ",,,,,,

c,Good read!,,,,,,
c,"The thing with kids is, if they want to grab for the gold ring, you have to let them do it, and not say anything. If they fall off, they fall off, but it's bad if you say anything to them. I truly believe this is a great novel; i could sympathize with holden, as i, like him, seem to always prefer being on my own and feel like i belong nowhere. i must confess that i appreciated this book more when i read the analysis, the meaning behind the recurring motifs and the symbolisms of this work. all in all this is a brilliant literary work, which deserves to be called a classic.",,,,,,
c,"Honestly, I would have liked We Are Okay more if the author had never gone into the complexities of the relationship between Marin and Mabel. Marin's story was compelling, with regards to her life and her background. When Marin walked away from her best friend and her former life, in an attempt to dispel the grief that threatened to engulf her, her motivation was strong enough to carry the book, without any extra entanglements. We Are Okay was a good book, but its abrupt ending and lack of plot development keep it from being great.",,,,,,
i,DNF,,,,,,
c,"Another book that had great promise, but needed a good editor. It is about a young girl whose self involved parents deaf her to Alaska. The writing is lovely, and the description of Alaska is beautiful, but the writes didn’t understand less is more. In the last third of the book we have domestic assault that leads to a murder, flight aided by a prominent townsperson sworn to secrecy, an out of wedlock pregnancy, the father in an accident that leaves him brain damaged, an arrest, a reconciliation and a happy ending. But again the writing is lovely and maybe the next book will be more organized.",,,,,,

c,"I have no idea why so many people gave this book five stars. It was a quick read, but the characters had little depth and are all stereotypical. Mia is the poor, starving artist. Elena (Mrs. Richardson) likes everything to be orderly (but of course nothing is). The Richardson kids (with the exception of Izzy) all fit typical high school student molds. Even Bebe's and her daughter May Ling's issues were not that out of the ordinary. How many times have people debated the cultural issues of Caucasian couples adopting Asian or African-American children? Finally, some of this novel was just not believable. What man would stalk Mia on the NYC subway and then tell her on the subway platform he wanted her to be a surrogate. Really? Finally, the book begins with fires being set and discloses who set the fires at the beginning. Why? This book had no surprises, was full of predictable characters and as I was reading it I felt like I was wasting my time. The only reason I finished this book was my book club picked it.",,,,,,
c,I really don't know what to say about this book. I'm at a loss words.,,,,,,
c,"This is the most misogynistic book I've read in a long time. There's transphobia, super one-dimensional and stereotypical characters, non-stop sexism, and even some stalking because our ""hero"" just KNOWS she doesn't really mean no, even though she SAID IT. So much rage. Would NOT recommend.",,,,,,
i,Too melodramatic. Too improbable. Didn't finish.,,,,,,
c,"I rarely dislike books. And even more rare for me is to write a review about a book I disliked. But this was awful. It felt like one long adjective. It took many chapters until descriptions stopped and an actual story began. And then when I thought the story was beginning, it just stopped. There was no substance. I should have just not finished it before the end but I kept wanting something to happen. Just not my cup of tea.
",,,,,,
c,"I just couldn't get into this book, I'm not sure why it has gotten so many high ratings. I found it trite, pandering and self-amused. If you're hopelessly in love with the 80s, you might enjoy it. Otherwise, skip it.
",,,,,,
c,"Was a good story but could have done without a few of the graphic details, especially the one about the rabbit’s heart!",,,,,,
c,"An outstanding sci-fi epic with many twists, turns, cyberpunk, etc. While I completely disagree with the dystopic premise (the world runs out of energy, causing terrible hardship and class warfare), it is this catalyst that drives the all-encompassing, immersive AR/VR world that consumes most of humanity, and of course, the lead characters. I really enjoyed many of the anecdotes about the 60s, 70s and 80s culture, and the evolution of gaming and tech. I also thought the characters were rich and well-developed. And, as an abstract metaphor for many of society's various permutations, the author did an excellent job in outlining how humanity may spend its future when there is little meaningful work to be done. . .because robots and highly automated operational systems will dominate.",,,,,,
c,"I had to deduct a star for the fact that entirely to much time was spent on a certain Canadian rock group that those who know me know I can't stand!!! Other than that, this book was so much fun that I may actually have to buy a hard copy for my very own. (This is that hard copy) It was the type of book that had me vastly irritated at all the ""adulting"" things I had to do.....you know, like work!! Work totally got in the way of my reading!! I loved all the 80's memories, the friendships, and the whole adventure!!",,,,,,
c,I have absolutely no idea why people love this book so immensely. I'm not going to bother myself and write a review. I didn't enjoy it one bit. The rating is less than 1 star.,,,,,,
c,"I kept hoping that the prose and plot would improve, but it never did. Too much detail was given to unimportant 80s facts and not enough time was spent on character development. Overall very disappointing.",,,,,,
i,DNF. There's only so much moaning I can take in a novel. This is not the book to read if you're a depressive.,,,,,,
c,"I read everything written by Kristin Hannah because I love her novels. BUT, this one was disappointing. I loved the description of Alaska- it became a character itself. However, it went on and on and on. The book could have been 100 pages shorter. The story was predictable and depressing. I liked the ending, but it took too long to get there.",,,,,,
c,I honestly don't even know how I feel about this book???,,,,,,
c,Didn't know what to expect from this book and reading about homosexuals makes me uncomfortable but I liked the message that you could live with someone for years and not really know them also the message that if you let them some people will jump to the moon and back for you,,,,,,
c,"This book absolutely captivated me. I couldn't put it down. Lately I have had a difficulty staying interested in books, the Fourth Monkey proved beyond a doubt it isn't me it is the books.  As someone else said, it is very hard to review this story without putting the whole thing behind a spoiler tag. And the author weaves little surprises throughout some I guessed and some literally left me gasping. A majority of the real time part of the story takes place in a mere 48 hours in modern Chicago, but a good portion of the book is presented as an autobiographical diary. The real time part involves the accidental death of a man that finally brings to the end the 5 year hunt for the Fourth Monkey Killer. A man the police have been hunting for 5 years. A killer who uses his crime to expose other criminals. He has a simple mission statement - See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak no Evil, Do no Evil. Immediately the police realize they have a problem the now deceased killer has taken one last victim and they need to find her before she dies. In the killer's pocket they find a diary which reveals the story of his childhood; it is parceled out slowly intertwined with the police procedural. This book had me reading on demanding to know what would happen next while regretting each page as being one closer to the ending.",,,,,,
c,"I loved the idea behind this book and enjoyed reading it, it is not a straightforward thriller it comes as no surprise to discover that the author has written horror books before, this for me at least was something of a mashup between horror and a thriller it was certainly not for those of a nervous or squeamish disposition.I thought the tension in the book was palpable and it worked for me I also liked the main detectives and the pace of the book was also good.I would take a deep breath and jump into another book written by this author and would recommend this one to fans of the genre.Thanks to Netgalley and the publishers for an ARC in return for an honest review.",,,,,,
c,Wow..all I can say is brilliant! Can't wait for the next one! I may have a new favorite author and series. I know when I find a gem if I read a book in one sitting and forgo sleep.,,,,,,
c,Loved it! Extremely well written. Excellent pace. And the creepiest villain since Mr. Mercedes.,,,,,,
c,"If I can prevent even one more person from buying this book I'll be happy. The only reason I read LFE was because it was our bookclub selection this month. I didn't know anything about it beforehand. Not since I read The Luckiest Girl have I been so disappointed by a book and annoyed at the author. Little Fires Everywhere is a pointless, cliched and biased story. Can't believe it was even published and on so many ""must read"" lists.",,,,,,
i,"DNF! The writing style annoys me, the main character/narrator annoys me... In conclusion, this is a very annoying book.",,,,,,
c,This book is recommended for every 40+ year old virgin in America. The writing was terrible. My brother asked me to read this and now I know he was playing a practical joke on me.,,,,,,
c,"Antihero. Yes. Icon for teenage rebellion? Maybe. Icon for future serial killers? Also, maybe. A good idea to shove it down the throats of eighth graders? Probably not.",,,,,,
i,Didn't get far into it before I realized I'd wasted my money.,,,,,,
c,"This is a solid work of young adult fiction. The book manages to transport you into the thoroughly fleshed out world of the virtual universe inside the OASIS, where the limits of human achievement and creativity are endless. You feel as if it were a real place. Besides that, I felt that the plot line was compelling and perfectly complimented the fictional world. The character development could perhaps have room for improvement, but it did not detract from my enjoyment of the story. I only understood about a third of the references made in the book [it could take decades to discover all of the pop-culture references (mainly from the '80s) hidden within its pages], but that did not take anything away from the experience. But if you enjoy '80s nostalgia, then you will particularly enjoy this book.",,,,,,
i,"Absolutely loved the authors first book, this one didn't hold my attention enough to finish the first 100 pages. The story didn't seem to be going anywhere and I didn't find the characters the least bit interesting.",,,,,,
c,I needed more from this book. It left me hanging a bit in certain places. I think strong relationships are fantastic and real relationships are even better. This is a quick and powerful read. Touches on mental illness and same gender love.,,,,,,
c,We Are Okay is ... okay. It was a smart and intertextual story about ghosts and overcoming grief.,,,,,,
c,"Nina LaCour's ""We Are Okay"" seems like a novel meant for a certain audience. It is an exquisitely written first person narrative of a young woman, Marin, who is withdrawing from others after a tragedy happens in her life. She grew up in San Francisco but is going to school in New York City. This distance has aided in her quest for distance but her best friend, Mabel, is now coming to visit so she has no escape. Marin opens to the reader about her sexuality, her grief, her uncertainty. Again, it is beautifully conveyed, but it is also unrelenting in its sadness which, for me anyway, made it dance close to melodrama. Yet, I think there is an audience for it and it is smooth, fast read.",,,,,,
c,"For me, this is the worst book I have read this year. The concept intrigued me and a brother of mine, who designs games, thought I would like it because I enjoy video games and 80's nostalgia. It's just...the main character is poorly written and developed. There's not a reason to get behind him and he makes several poor decisions in the book that produce unnecessary results and gets people killed, literally. Also, his love for Art3mis doesnt make sense and is really creepy. Seriously, this main character stalks and creeps on this girl throughout the entire book to a point where I found their relationship hard to believe or even care about. The 'gates' that wade has to go through on his quest are anticlimactic with the exception of the second gate. Some of the quests in the gates he goes on require him to act out scenes from movies...cool? Lastly, you'll be reading ""Of course, I knew that..."" or ""It was obvious that i..."" and ""Immediately, I knew..."" so much that you'll roll your eyes and push through.",,,,,,
i,It seems ridiculous to DNF this since I've made it past 50%. But ... I can't make myself read any further; there are too many other books I want to be reading instead.,,,,,,
c,"I think the purpose of this book is the same as the game creator's agenda, to get people interested in the United States culture from the 1980s. For anyone who's formative years were in the 80s, this is a fun romp down memory lane filled with arcade games, pop songs, and movie references from that era. I am a child of the 80s, and it worked on me like a charm! My Millennial daughter, however, was not so enchanted. Having been raised by me, she was familiar with the references, but was not enamored with them, so the story fell a little flat for her.
",,,,,,
c,"With a great, unforgettable first-person narrative, Holden Caulfield magnifies the bittersweet adolescence we all went through – with, in my point of view, a sort of exaggeration Salinger employed to get his point across: as though he’s shoving in Holden all the snottiness he possibly can, in an effort to make him the archetype of adolescent negativity. All with the mood swings, urges, shooting hormones and yes, of course, that unique quality teens have that makes the rest of the world just want to punch them in the eye.Holden, however, showed some endearing traits that sometimes escaped in-between all the arrogance. That, to me, served to prove that adolescence fades. Those traits felt like little bits of maturity already starting to sprout. Even if you can’t relate to Holden specifically, this novel is nostalgic. I get why this is a classic.",,,,,,
i,"DNF half way through. Holden was so whiny, I couldn't read the whole thing. I did enjoy class discussions and I understand the themes in the book and why Holden was the way he was. Still, I won't go through the hell of reading from his point of view.",,,,,,
c,This has no story and is very hard to finish. If you like continuous sex saying the same thing over and over and over then this is your cup of tea. I can't imagine what her next book is about. This the first time I have had to give a poor review.,,,,,,
c,Bad. I wrote a review on goodreads about how much I hate this book. I can summarize it here though. This book is a list of things. It's not a story. It's a list of things that the author likes.,,,,,,
i,The writing style is so juvenile I couldn't get through the first 50 pages. Absolute crap.,,,,,,
c,"Yes, I know, this is the book that changed everyone's lives when they read it and how dare I, blah blah. Believe me, I heard it all. The thing is, Holden's personality is what holds the whole book together. Now, I know many (many! believe me!) people who identify with Holden, and admire his struggle and need to rebel against a hypocritical society. And then there are people (like me) who can't fucking stand Holden. So the book falls apart for those people. I read this book while I was in hospital, and to be honest, it was a very dark time for me and I wasn't really sure I was going to make it, but you guys have no idea how trivial, how ridiculously spoiled and self-absorbed Holden Caulfield seems to someone who reads him while going through some serious shit. I was supposed to be fighting for my life but I took moments aside to wish for his life to end! So, if you like this book, great! I'm always happy when people like books, even books I dislike, and I can't fault J.D. Salinger's writing in any way, it's Holden's character I hate. So this is one of those books that always makes me go, ""Really?"" but I understand that it's one that will have a different impact on the reader, depending on what place he or she is in life.",,,,,,
i,"Dumb book. It was page after page of teenage lust and hormones. I kept waiting for a real story to emerge, but gave up and skimmed quickly through the whole book, trying to see who killed Mykala's family. By the time I found out, I certainly didn't care.",,,,,,
c,"I really love this author, but I didn't think this book was as good as some of her others. It is a bit slow in places and I found myself skimming from time to time to get to more interesting parts. Overall, it was a good story.",,,,,,
c,"Extremely disappointed in Kristin Hannah ‘s new book. I have read all her other books and throughly found them great reads, characters and stories. This new book Great Alone is tedious boring and unbelievable. Drags on and on and goes nowhere. So disappointed. Pre-ordered and was looking forward to her new book but sadly this one was way off mark.",,,,,,
c,"I like the way Kristin Hannah writes, but this book was too depressing for me. Then the ending was too sappy sweet. I also expected more encounters with wildlife within this storyline and was surprised there were so few mentions.",,,,,,
c,I don't think I've ever hated a book as much as I hated The Catcher in the Rye. I really wanted to DNF it but it was only 230 pages long so I got through it. I hope I never have to read the word 'phoney' again.,,,,,,
c,such nonsense... I do not know where to begin. How did this get highly rated? I think I read (half read) a different book.,,,,,,
i,"I've just had an Apendix operation and that made me realise that I experience the same pain while reading this book so... I'm not going to make a whole review for a book I've never finished, but let me just say that this shit is triggering in the way you want to smack Holden with a chair. But oh no! I'd probably be a phony. Give me a break.",,,,,,
c,"I loved this book about Holden Caulfield; told from his point of view, which made me feel as if I was sitting across from him, listening with empathic understanding- it disturbs me that some dismiss this story as one about a whiny teenaged brat.Holden is clearly suffering from anxiety and terrible depression, and at the age of sixteen, has been thrown out of three schools. Despite this, he is funny, caring, intelligent and insightful, and as far as he is concerned the only people who are not ""phoney"" are children. Holden likes kids, and he's good with them, he is especially close to his ten year old sister Phoebe.Throughout his story Holden mentions many times how depressed he is and a few times he states that he wishes he was dead. He has suffered great loss and trauma; the death of his beloved brother Allie. Holden also witnessed the suicide of a classmate and had reason to believe that his favorite teacher tried to molest him.As I read about Holden on his journey around New York city, I sensed that he was becoming more anxious, so anxious that he experienced two panic attacks, during one he passed out. A big part of Holden's problem is his fear of growing up, and a longing for his childhood. He hates change, and desperately wants things to stay the same, this is why he loved the museum and the carousel. Things in the museum had stayed the same for decades, and Holden went there as a child, his life was happier when he was a kid, when Allie was alive. At the end of Holden's story he is watching Pheobe ride the carrousel. ""It played the same song about fifty years ago when I was a little kid. That's one nice thing about carrousels, they always play the same songs."" While watching Phoebe on the carrousel ride, Holden tells us how happy he feels. Holden has revealed this part of his troubled life in the confines of a psychiatric hospital, and at the end of the book I had a hopeful feeling that things would get better for him.",,,,,,
c,"Hated this book. Juvenile, unlikable, undeveloped characters - I should say caricatures - unbelievable story lines, trite over-simplified take on complex issues and situations, awkward writing......",,,,,,
c,"What a horrible bullshit book. I would give it no stars if I could, but that's for DNF books and unfortunately I had to finish it. Thanks book club, haha. I seriously can't understand how this ever turned into a classic?? Nothing happens and the main character is so frustrating and boring. Some of the high ratings surprise me, because REALLY? REALLY? This is all I have to say about this.",,,,,,
c,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The story is thin, the characters are awkward and annoying and the storytelling is down-right awful. Don't read this book.
",,,,,,
i,"DNF. I barely started it and it already felt like a cheap Bukowskian novel to me. I hate Bukowski's character(s), but at least he had a way with words, cussing and booze and misogyny aside. This would just end up being a waste of bookreading time for me, and I didn't want to end up hating it. So yeah, thank you but no thank you.",,,,,,
c,"I enjoyed the book - the story was well done and it was an easy read. I did not spend my teens playing Atari or watching 80s sitcoms, so a lot of the references in the book were lost on me. Still, Cline did a decent job of making the story accessible to a moderate nerd like myself. My guess is that you will enjoy the book a lot less if you've never seen Star Wars, Monty Python, and a handful of similar cult classics, or never played video games.",,,,,,
c,"I've barely started this book and I already dislike it. It's a shame, too, since unlike so many other readers of Kristin Hannah's books, I absolutely hated ""The Nightingale."" Both books are nothing like a typical Kristin Hannah book, which is why I don't like either one of them. Too dark, too dreary, miserable, etc. While one book, ""The Nightingale,"" was about one of my least favorite subjects, Nazi Germany, this book, ""The Great Alone,"" is just plain sad and loaded with people whom I can't stand. It's an annoying book but since I bought the hardcover version, I'll make myself finish this novel. I'm sure it will go on endlessly page by page as another reviewer already stated in her one-star review. I'm concerned, now, that my favorite author has changed the types of novels she writes and won't ever again write one I can adore in the way that she'd always written her others, before ""The Nightingale."" I want the old Kristin Hannah back. Stop with the dreary and uncomfortable subject matter, please!",,,,,,
c,"I made a mistake in ordering this instead of another book of the same title. It was not worth shipping it back and I like teen fiction, so I gave it a shot. No. This book is not ready for a wide audience. I like premise. I think there's a good start. It just needs more time in the editing phase. I passed it on through the neighborhood Little Free Library. Hopefully someone else will find it and enjoy it more than I did.",,,,,,
c,"Every few years I reread this book...one of the first books I ever read that made me think ""how did the author know I was feeling that same way?"" Has become entwined with my youth and all the possibilities that existed at the beginning of my ""life road"".",,,,,,
i,"DNF - 63%. I'm not going to waste any more time reading a book that I just don't ""appreciate"". I know how this is supposed to be about the mysterious human hybrid species known as the ""teenager"" and their supposedly unbiased and almost naïve analysis of adult life, but I just don't see it. Us teens actually have some personality and INTELLIGENCE, for pete sake! Also, have you ever heard a teenager address every single freaking person as ""Old [insert name here]""? No.",,,,,,
c,"This is my first book read listed in 100 Must Read Books for Men (Bloomsbury) and I liked it. It is devoid of the usual melodrama and direct in its storytelling approach. I also got very interested on this because I read in 500 Must Read Books for Men that the assassin of J. F. Kennedy read this book prior to the assassination and the guy you attempted to kill Ronald Reagan was also fond of this book. On the more positive side, George W. Bush said in one interview that he got inspiration from this book when he was growing up. Just like Great Gatsby, this is one of the required readings in high school all over the U.S. I think it is because this novel's main message is that teenagers normally pass through a phase where they feel alienated and misunderstood. In the novel, the main protagonist, Holden was kicked out from school and he ran away thinking that his parents would not understand him. He had this dream of ""catching children falling on cliffs"" (where the title came from) which was actually a metaphor since in the end it was his baby sister, Phoebe, who made him go back home (thereby saving his future). The only thing that prevented me from rating this with 5 stars is the language - the colloquial English, the cursing, etc. However, it is said to be the way teenagers spoke in the 50's in New York. ",,,,,,
i,"Couldn't read past the 4th chapter--not sure if the actual plot is good (although I had guessed one of the 'major events' within the first few paragraphs), it was primarily the writing that I couldn't handle. I would expect this type of writing from some 14 year old on Wattpad, but not on an actual published piece of work.",,,,,,
c,"The story develops at an incredibly slow, crawling pace. The characters are hollow (I know they're avatars but even so lack substance and credibility). It took me a lot of effort to reach the end and I admit the final 70 pages are better but then again all the action should (and could) have been more evenly spread throughout the novel. Very weak, annoying and forgettable. Hopefully the movie will be more fun.",,,,,,
c,"Wasn't a fan of the writing style but much impressed with the quantity of references to late 60s, 70s, and 80s pop culture. As the name suggests, the book focuses on computers and games. I'm not a fan of dystopian storylines, I prefer fantasy and escapism into ideal realities. In the book, the Oasis allowed that escapism into whatever the player's ideal reality might be. This book focuses on the gunters of Wade's world and the Oasis. Fun read. I recommend having a computer close by to look up unfamiliar references for your own Almanac.
",,,,,,
c,"I genuinely hated this book. It seemed pointless, plotless and badly written. I don't understand why it's so praised and celebrated. I know that it was written from an adolescent's poin of view, but reading the combinations of the only 3 words he knows over and over again was pure torture.",,,,,,
c,"I was pretty torn with how to rate this book. This was a re-read for me. I first read it in high school and had forgotten many details. I originally had rated it 4 stars but I now rate it 4.5 stars. What most appealed to me when I read it in high school was the writing style. Yes, the character is highly flawed and often annoying, but it was the first novel I had read that was written in such a relatable and conversational style. ",,,,,,
c,"This time around it was less the writing style and more the story that captivated me. I was worried Caulfield would be more annoying to me as an adult, but I found the opposite. He broke my heart. In a good way. ",,,,,,
i,"DNF: One of the most overrated books of all time. In my opinion it's a boring, depressing and poorly written book. The pace? Well there is no pace. Plus no drive. The characters are less interesting than wallpaper paste. And the plot? Well it's basically just about a teenager talking about how bad he is at everything. That's it! But at least my thoughts on this book haven't changed since 1986 when i first tried to read it.",,,,,,
c,I have an MA in English. This book was horrible. I'm baffled by the glowing reviews.,,,,,,
c,"Well I was expecting to find something in this book that wasn't there. It's a renowned classic a 'book to read before you die' after all. The first half I was sorry for Holden Caulfield his agony at the loss of his brother, his isolation, his teenaged angst, but in the end I was irritated by him and the writing style. I maybe should have read this when I was younger but for me it didn't work.Very easy to read and very well written. It grabbed me from the first page, I just wish there was more of it.",,,,,,
c,"I honestly thought that this was the one of the classics I liked in high school, but I was wrong. I found Holden to be extremely whiney and all over the place. I mean I guess that's what Salinger was going for but it took me a good while to get through this book. By the time I finished it, I was wondering why in the heck I didn't DNF it. Sorry, Salinger but I have to rate this 1 out of 4 stars. No Bueno. But hey that's one more ""Rory Gilmore"" Challenge out of the way.",,,,,,
i,"I don't understand the raving over this book. I got a few chapters in before I just couldn't take the cringe-worthy dialogue anymore. It's like the author didn't bother reading the dialogue back to himself before he decided, ""Yeah, this sounds totally natural."" Get ready for pages and pages of grown men calling each other ""noob"", ""dipsh*t"", ""p*ssy"", and a variety of other juvenile insults while they argue over things that have zero impact on the plot. It's like someone transcribed a group of 13-year-old boys arguing on XBox Live, then added proper sentence structure and grammar--it's totally bizarre. If the story had more substance, I could have grit my teeth and suffered through the corny dialogue, but unfortunately the ""story"" is really just an endless string of references to 80s pop culture. I guess nostalgia is a powerful drug.",,,,,,
c,"Somehow it held my interest, but felt disappointing when compared to The Nightingale. Just not nearly as well written or interesting or compelling Good story, but also felt simplistic in character development.
",,,,,,
i,About 50% of this novel is the main character explaining minutiae over random 80s trivia. This is both ridiculous and sad. I finished about 20% of the book and couldn't go any further.,,,,,,
i,"My least favorite Kristin Hannah book, could not finish it.",,,,,,
i,"dnf 35% I really tried. I did. It's just I'm too bored by this book to keep reading. I thought I would really like Holden... but as it turned out I just got annoyed by the way he talked about things and the way he kept repeating himself. Maybe I will try to read this later in my life, when I have more time. (I keep saying this about all the other classics I didn't finish but I really don't see myself reading any of them anytime soon).",,,,,,
c,"The book itself didn't actually ""inform my sexuality"" as the shelf implies but my used copy had a very realistic sketch of a penis drawn somewhere in the middle and I hadn't actually seen a penis that up close before, so all in all I'd have to say it was very informative.",,,,,,
i,I wanted to like this book just I just couldn't get into it. Thank goodness I had the audio book. I just let it play. Still my mind wandered and kept losing interest. Finally I returned it for something else. Yawn!,,,,,,
c,such nonsense... I do not know where to begin. How did this get highly rated? I think I read (half read) a different book.,,,,,,
c,I can't understand all the 5 star reviews. I'm struggling to finish this book just to find out if there is an answer to the fire. The book is filled with sexual tension and jealousy and goes on and on and on..... Definately will not be reading the rest of this series. Glad this was part of the Prime membership - would have been mad at myself for buying this one!,,,,,,
c,I loved this book. I do not give 5 stars because that is reserved for perfection. 4 & 3/4 is my real rating. I have some favorite songs from the 80's that transport me back there whenever I hear them. This book had that same effect. I was about the same age as the main characters of the story then and the games mentioned were quite familiar to my pals and me. The arcades were where the action was at for our crowd. Good times to be a young person. I think I will turn on some Rush and play some Rampage now.,,,,,,
i,"DNF. I know in the historical context why this book is important, but I hear this same thing every day. The most sympathetic way I can view this character is that he is clinically depressed and needs help. I still find that generous interpretation unlikely based on how the character has been viewed in my research. None of the presentations of the ""poor"", rich, white boy cause me to be sympathetic. It makes me want to say, ""Get over yourself. You, Mr. Caulfield, are the real phony in this story. You hate the phoniness of the world? Do something instead of whining about it. Now excuse me, I need to go work on my own phoniness."" ",,,,,,
c,I finished this today and wow I really loved it which was somewhat unexpected. It's hard to say how I would have felt about it had I read it in high school. I don't think teenage Amanda would really have liked it or cared at all about Holden. I loved Holden even though he was a total spoiled pain in the ass. I felt his pain and his loneliness. I'm not sure I really get what the big deal is about this book and why it seems to be the quintessential America high school assignment but I'm really glad I finally got around to reading it. ,,,,,,
c,"I don't like the fact that its everyone's point of veiw. Kinda lost my interest. I like books where its not jumping from person to person
",,,,,,
c,"Okay, finished Ready Player One. Did not like it. I don't understand how books like RP1 become best sellers when Game of Throne's, the first book, didn't even hit the list and Clash of Kings only made it to 13 when they were originally released. GoT is far better written, far more engaging, better developed characters, etc. RP1 diguises a shoddily crafted story with bland characters by means of overwhelming the readers with a data dump of geekery. It's the Da Vinci Code of nerdery. I have to upgrade my did not like to ""Hated it."" Sorry.",,,,,,
c,"The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because I did actually make it to the last page. Though in hindsight, I might have been happier with my purchase if I'd abandoned it halfway through. The only tension driving this story was sexual tension, and whilst I usually love sexual tension, the author teased so much that the scenes ended up irritating me by the end. I was flicking through page after page, bored. Why couldn't Kayla and Jake kiss? Why couldn't they have sex? The answer to this is as unbelievable as the rest of the plot. The pain Kayla feels at any point of the book doesn't translate to the page. I was unmoved by a most of it, and, even though I was expecting the twist with Megan at the end, I rolled my eyes because it was so, so, so silly. Overall, this was a very disappointing read after so many five star reviews. The only thing I can commend the author on is having the courage to put her work out there",,,,,,
c,"I chose this book because I like Kristin Hannah's writing style. As the other books of hers that I have read, it's easy to understand and contains historical facts. This book deals with a veteran's PTSD, domestic violence and a wife's submissive behavior. At times I felt myself cringing at the content of the domestic violence. Her descriptions of Alaska in Winter are so beautiful as well as daunting at the same time. When Hannah mentions the northern lights I could visualize them in my head. Towards the ending it became a little tedious for me but I did like the final end..",,,,,,
i,DNF. I tried. I really did. After realizing that every classic I've ever attempted to read I went through my entire to-read list and removed them all. I just can't. Bravo to anyone who really enjoys these they're just not my cup of tea. The entire story is about a boy thinking everyone he knows is phoney (his words). He drops/flunks out of school. Then because he doesn't want his parents to know just spends all night traveling around NYC trying to meet up with all these people. Only to realize that he doesn't really have any friends. Literally that's the story. I mean there's a deeper meaning to it I know that I had to look up on cliff notes ha but it just wasn't good to me. Not my style of writing to read.,,,,,,
i,I really wanted to like this one. I had heard so many great things about it but I found it slow and it didn't hold my interest. DNF.,,,,,,
c,"This is how I felt about this novel, I loved the story but I didn’t care for Marin. Okay, I said it. It’s a weird combination because Marin really makes up the whole story but that is how I felt after reading it. The story flashes back and forth between the current time period and the end of her senior year. I enjoyed this small flip of the clock as I really got to see the full picture.In the present time, Marin is living in her college dorm, alone, as everyone else has left for holiday break. Flashing back, we see Marin living with her Gramps before heading off to college. This novel is heavy with emotion, the words drawing themselves out slowly across the pages, and each relationship was vital and significant. I thought Marin’s relationship with her Gramps was strange: they got along great, he tried to instill life’s lessons on her, but their house seemed to be divided and there were issues that were never addressed. I had to wonder if Gramps was really okay, was there more problems that were not addressed. Marin felt like an island to me, she felt distinct and aloof, even with her own Gramps. As the novel became more emotional, it became all about Marin and nothing about the larger picture which I thought include many other individuals. I thought she was quick to blame others when she should have had been looking in the mirror. I also thought, she was running from herself on many levels. I did enjoy the relationship between Marin and Mable, it might have been too as Mable wanted her part in it but it takes two to make it work. Marin sees this relationship having many fronts but again I think Marin thought only of herself. Marin, Marin, Marin, the world is bigger than you.",,,,,,
c,"After finishing this book, I rated it three stars. I had just browsed the glowing reviews of fellow GR members and fell pray to the idea that I should like the book more than I did. But the more I thought about it, the less comfortable I felt with my rating. I just didn't think this book was very good. It was kind of like reading Since We Fell all over again. Not only are both books bogged down by tedious (albeit, in this case, gory) backstory, but they also contain frankly ludicrous plot developments. Underneath the icky serial killer MO, this is a very average, forgettable mystery that only produces surprises when verging on the ridiculous. The Fourth Monkey starts with the death of a serial killer; one who has evaded capture for years and has a very distinctive method - he sends the victim's family the ear first (hear no evil), then the eyes (see no evil), then the tongue (speak no evil), and finally the corpse is found with a sign - DO NO EVIL. Hence the four monkeys. So when a man is found dead, carrying a signature white box with an ear inside, the homicide detective Sam Porter knows two things: 1) this must be the man they've been looking for, and 2) there's a girl locked up somewhere who will die if they don't find her fast. On 4MK's person is a diary documenting his bizarre childhood and the more Sam Porter reads, the more he starts to believe that the killer is playing with them in death as he did in life.I found it quite a dull read for the most part. One ""twist"" about Sam Porter's past is both obvious and worthy of a serious eye roll. Other than that, though, Sam is given very little development. I love thrillers that make you care deeply about the characters, especially the detectives, but Sam is pretty stock. I will have forgotten him by tomorrow.Also, there are no other characters worth remembering. The cartoon villainis almost comical in his theatrical performances. He is not complex; rather, he practically walks around twirling his mustache and saying ""Muahaha"". When we delve into his past, the story gets ever more bizarre. And not in an interesting way. After 4MK goes through some standard serial killer motions (killing cats, perving on naked women), we get caught up in some farfetched mafia plot line. Long, boring diary excerpts and ridiculous twists? I'll pass on the sequel.",,,,,,
c,"This one brought me back to the days of arguing over D&D character builds at the decidedly ""uncool"" lunch table in high school. The references to 80s video games, music, and television were fun, even for someone born in '89. I thought the characters and dialogue were enjoyable, and the social commentary, while certainly not original, was apt. My one complaint would be the heavy exposition dropped in the opener, which usually scares me off. Glad I stuck it out. This is one that will tug at the heart strings of anyone obsessed with pop culture.
",,,,,,
c,"I've found it particularly difficult to write a review for this one. Whenever I tried to transfer my thoughts to paper ( ok ipad ) I found that ( in my excitement) I seemed to be giving away some small detail that would possibly spoil it for other readers. The shock and horror that I personally felt whilst reading this story, would have little value for others if they knew what they were about to read. Unusually, the story begins with the death of the man known as The Fourth Monkey Killer, a killer that has terrorised Chicago for the last 5 years. We're all familiar with the three monkeys - hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. The fourth monkey represents 'do no evil' which, coming from a serial killer is something of a contradiction in terms! On the day he dies, he was about to deliver a message to police informing them of his latest abduction, so the race is now on to discover her whereabouts before it's too late. The killer leaves behind a handful of clues for Detective Sam Porter, not least a personal diary, which dates back to his childhood. Herein lies the fascination with this story - this was no ordinary childhood - and his thoughts and actions (given his age) are utterly chilling! Oh boy, this was a completely gripping storyline , but exceptionally graphic, and not for the squeamish. It played havoc with my emotions and was really distressing at times, yet impossible to put down.So why, if I found parts of it so distressing would I rate it 5 Stars? Well, it was an exceptionally clever and well thought out plot - the writing was simply superb - and the author brought this serial killer very much to life, the minutiae of his life story was utterly absorbing, and then there was the conclusion - just when I thought it had ended, when everything had been done and dusted, there was another twist right on the last page, and oh boy was it a cracker!! As psycholigcal thrillers go, it doesn't get any better than this. A remarkable read that I think will be one of the stand out books of 2017!* Thank you to Netgalley, HQ and J.D.Barker for my ARC for which I have given an honest unbiased review* ",,,,,,
c,"Feed your Jones for 80'a nostalgia, with this story of a boy who must solve the ultimate Adventure game to save the world. Rich with references to old bands, songs, TV shows, and video games. The early chapters were a little heavy on narration and light on action, but Cline seemed to find his stride after a few chapters. It will be interesting to see how the movie interprets this book.",,,,,,
c,"Too verbose. Meaning? Waste of time, thought there would be more to it than the way it ended. My opinion.",,,,,,
i,"I couldn't finish this book. I was all for the nostalgia, but I found it just too unrealistic for my tolerance. Future youth being obsessed with 80s culture (to the smallest minute details) is comparable to people my age being obsessed with 40s and 50s pop culture; even with the Wonka-flavored contest, the number of Gunters seemed too large for such a niche area of knowledge (at least with Wonka, any random person could win as long as they bought a chocolate bar). There were also a lot of overworked tropes. I stopped after 100 or so pages. I feel like a bad nerd, and so many of my friends love this!",,,,,,
c,This is the holy grail of terrible mass-market fiction. This thing reads like a fifth-grader's creative writing assignment. It's so poorly written that it makes me wonder if it's not just an indictment of its target audience --- is it poking fun at how low the bar for mainstream science fiction writing is? Probably not. This book stinks to high heaven.,,,,,,
c,Fantastic thriller and a good start with the killer / cop relationship.Not too slick or reliant on twists (just a tiny one to make it interesting). Looking forward to the next.,,,,,,
c,"I loathed this book. 80s nostalgia porn as a plot device sucked. I can't even remember the actual story, the characters, or conclusion because it's just horribly written and overshadowed by everything 80s related in this novel.

c,"Terrible. If you get the references and are looking to connect with your kid about your childhood, you might read this book together. You might. They still won't understand or respect you.",,,,,,
c,"I have to give this creepy thriller 5 stars, for in-depth characters, a twisted original plot, and a (slightly) unexpected finish. Serial killers can be amusing! I was annoyed at the beginning with some of the macho male detectives, but learned to tolerate them. Also, some of the plot and description didn't ""fit."" Later in the book, it does. I am looking forward to more from this author, and what his devious mind will imagine.",,,,,,
i,"I had several people recommend this novel to me. I gave it three or four solid attempts for it to engage me but it was fruitless. I made it through a few chapters but I just couldn't stand all the references anymore. I tend to analyze a book based on Twain's guide to writing. In it he says a lot of things, but the biggest offenders with this tale were characters that act like human beings and scenes that can be built in time and space. Before the internet gets all mad about it being science fiction in a virtual reality world so how can you hold it to those standards, the point is that even if the situation is fantastical, characters should act like humans would act in that situation and environments have to be constructed and fit in relationship to all the other objects in the world. I don't believe an 18 year old kid would have the ennui coupled with the maturity displayed by the main character. It is clear this is a book written by Gen Xers for Gen Xers, which that may have value to some. But, even with being on the cusp of being a Gen Xer myself, I found the constant barrage of '80s nostalgia exhausting and distracting. It had the potential for a good story, the writing was lacking. I simply couldn't force myself through it anymore, reading is supposed to be fun, not a chore. It was worth my eight bucks to stop putting myself through that. Ultimately, I'd rather have my eight bucks, but worth it to stop.",,,,,,
c,"I liked it. Didn't love it, didn't hate it... liked it. I thought it was entertaining, but the characters were really underdeveloped and some of the dialogue was clunky. I also couldn't help but roll my eyes at a lot of writing in the diary. I get what he was trying to do with it, but I didn't love it. Also, the fact that I was able to put this book down for two weeks and not feel the need to rush back to it says a lot. I'm someone who will stay up all night to finish a book if it's really hooking me. This one lost me a bit in the middle. I guess with the high rating and rave reviews, I was just expecting more.",,,,,,
c,"Horrible soap opera, void of anything about Alaska. Plot and conclusion revealed in first chapters.",,,,,,
c,"My thoughts on Ready Player One are split into two halves. On the one hand, the characters are generic stereotypes with no depth, many of the nostalgia bits feel tacked on without really fitting properly, and the author is prone to long tangents about some 80s factoid that distract from the pacing and surroundings. On the other hand, not only was the plot engaging enough that I completed the book in marathon form only rarely taking time to put it down, but it left a strong enough image of its universe in my head that I found myself thinking back to it days later - which can't be said for all books. As such, despite some flaws, I give the book an overall strong recommendation for being great fun.",,,,,,
c,"If you can get passed that the writer writes like a high school sophomore, you might find an interesting story here. It's painful reading.",,,,,,
c,Do. Not. Bother. Poorly written. Vacuous characters. Wish I could rate this waste of time a with no star.,,,,,,
c,"This would be a pretty good book for a 16 year old girl or serialized in Good Housekeeping magazine. Think of all the brilliant fiction that has been written about suburbia by authors like Franzen, Russo, Lahiri, Yates, Guest, Eugenides, etc. This book is written in a sophomoric style that would appeal to a YA reader with hardly breakthrough ideas about supposed Liberal suburbia in the 90's. Contrived story with no new insight. Just something to take up time.",,,,,,
c,"If I could give this book less than one star I would. This was awful. I normally don't finish reading books that I'm not enjoying, but my book club was reading this one and I had to finish it. The writing just wasn't good and was hard for me to get through. The dialogue was poorly constructed and the plot felt like it was using every single cliche known to man. There were also lots of contradictions and holes all throughout the plot that made it more and more unbelievable. This felt like a writer's first attempt at a story, not a novel by an award-winning author. I also didn't feel any real suspense or mystery. I definitely would not recommend this book. ",,,,,,
c,"A talented writer. Hollywood will love this. Why only 3 stars? Not to sound like a prude but the graphic nature of the Diary sections of the book were over-the-top. So much so, I almost didn't finish the book. This is an author who is looking to justify the anti-hero, which is ""So-last-century."" His ""protagonists"" were painfully static, cliche-laden bores. His understanding of how police would respond to the events he described is quite superficial. The FBI would be in on a case like this, it wouldn't be left to some gum-shoe and his partner. ",,,,,,
c,"After reading this author's first book, I purchased this one before its actual release date without even reading its description (that's how much I enjoyed the writer's previous work) but this book was so disappointing and such a waste of time and money. It was all over the place and there were so many holes that just didn't connect stories and the overall plot together. Did not enjoy it and could not wait to finish it. The ending was also abrupt but the entire story just didn't contain fluid writing and was quite disappointing in its context.",,,,,,
i,I'm putting this book down for good after a few chapters. The hype surrounding this novel got me interested but it is simply a slurry of late 20th century video game and movie references attempting to pander to the reader's nostalgia. It got to be ridiculous after a while as the constant 80s pop trivia set to the tune of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory kept pulling me out of the story. In my adulthood I'm still learning to walk away from a book unfinished and this one gave me an opportunity to prove my ability to do so.,,,,,,
c,"This book did not agree with me. I now have literary word poisoning. Go read Wool instead, or re-read Snow Crash. This is just indulgent and sad.
",,,,,,
c,From start to finish-a great book! Disturbing sometimes but worth it!,,,,,,
c,"I strongly dislike this book. It is the most cliche filled story I've encountered in a long time. It almost always chooses to do the silliest option and I would argue that one could guess most of the big moments that'll happen by the books end in the first 30 or so pages. It is literally just one trope flowing into another and we're talking like the most overdone tropes in the genre by far. To the point where it almost reads like a parody. The protagonist has a single character attribute that defines him just one and it's the most cliche characteristic in a detective story at this point. The book is full of laughably silly moments as well, just small lines that are easy to look past if the rest of the book is good, but in a book like this, it's just more wood on the fire (things like a homicide detective in today's age not knowing what twitter is). The antagonist is an attempt at Hannibal Lecter but ends up feeling like a parody of the more popular socio/psychopath killer characters, to the point where his backstory is cartoonish. The ending improves things a little bit and the diary entries are good albeit a bit silly, but it's definitely the least trope filled part of the book",,,,,,
c,Did not enjoy,,,,,,
i,"I read over half of this book before DNFing it. I just couldn't read anymore. It was utterly repulsive and demented and I've read my share of murder mysteries. I also didn't really connect with, or care for the characters and found the plot confusing in parts. It just wasn't for me.",,,,,,
c,"If I had to pick one word for this book I would probably say indulgent. If you weren't into 80s pop culture and/or didn't play video games in the 80s this book probably is not for you. That said, if you've ever played Pac-Man, Zork, Double Dragon or if you've ever seen Wargames or Star Wars (and actually saw it in the 80s or early 90s) this book is probably worth a shot for you. Overall, it's actually a very interesting premise and does definitely get into the human obsession with escapism, but it also has fun stuff like D&D, giant robots, some Matthew Broderick, etc. It's a fun read and I definitely recommend it.",,,,,,
i,"This book just didn't work for me. For one thing it was way too gory and the frequent use of the ""F"" word was a big turnoff, totally unnecessary. The story bounced around with multiple points of view, the killer's diary, the captive teen, and the police. I didn't even get half way through before I was bored with it. Sorry I wasted my money. Very disappointing after all the hype.",,,,,,
c," Sift a pinch of psychology with a scant tablespoon of theology, add one part Island of the Blue Dolphin with two parts philosophy, mix with a pastry blender or the back of a fork until crumbly but not dry and there you have Pi and his lame-o, cheesed out, boat ride to enlightenment. Actually I liked the beginning of this book- loved Pi's decleration and re-naming of himself, his adding religions like daisy's to a chain, and was really diggin on the family as a whole and then....then, then, then the tarpaulin. I did learn some things though, I learned that: a). cookies work wonders in assuaging heated arguments. b). Tiger turds do NOT taste good, no mater how hungry you are and hold absolutely no nutritional value (actualy this might apply only to turds obtained from tigers that have been floating on rafts for several weeks/months? I think I'll apply it as a general rule). I wanted to like this book more - I loved the cover and then there's that little golden seal that keeps going psst, psst, you don't get it - it's waaaay deep, you missed the whole point. But I think no, I got the point, like a 2 by 4 to the forehead I got the dang point! What I lack in spelling, this author lacks in subtlty. I felt like the ending was a study guide/cliff notes pamphlet/wikepedia entry all in one. I love Pi in the first 3rd, I understand the merits of Pi in the raft (just not my thing), but pi in the last bit - ugh, ugh,ugh! I'm chocking on the authors shoving of moral down my throat - help! help! I can't breath.......2 stars for the beginning, negative 3 stars for the ending, add something (or subtract to make it equal a positive - ????) and there you have my 2 starred LIfe of Pi review.",,,,,,
c,"I read this book two years ago, but when we discussed it this month for book club, I remembered how much I liked it. A good discussion always ups my appreciation of a novel as does an ending that makes me requestion my givens in the story. I find myself reading contradictory interpretations and agreeing with both sides. That's the beauty of symbolism: as long as you back up your cause, it's plausible. Initially it took me several weeks to get into the book. The beginning reads more like a textbook with inserted clips of the main character's future self. While the knowledge I gained about zoology and theology was interesting, it wasn't intriguing enough to keep me awake for more than a few pages at a time and often I found the tidbits a confusing distraction. But with distance I enjoyed the backdrop information it offered. If you're struggling through the initial background, jump ahead to the second section. Yeah it's important, but it's not vital. And maybe once you've read the story you'll want to come back and appreciate his analysis.I highly enjoyed this strange journey at sea and found it almost believable--until the castaways encounter the island at which point I wondered how much of his sanity wavered. Being shipwreck is one of a plethora of phobias I have. Throw on top my even stronger fear of tigers and this was a story straight out of a nightmare, one that kept me intrigued for a resolution. How could a boy keep the upper hand shipwrecked with a tiger? I had a picture in my head of Pi clinging to the side of the boat to avoid both the salty water infested with sharks and a foodless boat housing a hungry carnivore.I found myself stuck in the unusual place where as a reader I find a story plausible with full knowledge that had this story been presented in real life I would have doubted its authenticity. I wanted to believe the story and all its fantasy. The end initially annoyed me, but if you look at the rich metaphors in the story, it becomes delectable for a story analyst like me. There is nothing I enjoy more than tearing apart a story and pulling out the intentions and symbols buried inside. Instead of just a fantastical story, you find a fable with a moral. Spoilers here. (view spoiler) Some of my favorite quotes from the book:""Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it, a jealous, possessive love that grabs at what it can."" ""It was my luck to have a few good teachers in my youth, men and women who came into my dark head and lit a match. ""Doubt is useful for a while...But we must move on. To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation."" ""All living things contain a measure of madness that moves them in strange, sometimes inexplicable ways."" ""Memory is an ocean and he bobs on the surface."" ""First wonder goes deepest; wonder after that fits in the impression made by the first."" ""The main battlefield for good is not the open ground of the public arena but the small clearing of each heart.""",,,,,,
c,I loved this book! I watched the film before reading the book and I loved both of them. I enjoy short chapters so this was good for me. Best scene was the 3 religious men arguing about Pi's religion. Found it really smartly done and funny.,,,,,,
c,"For years I noticed this book on display, particularly its cartoonish paperback cover. Was it a children's book? This Pi stuff -- was it something about math? It's a castaway story and like all castaway and shipwreck stories it's about human endurance, indomitable spirit and man vs. nature. The things that distinguish this story from Robinson Crusoe or Tom Hanks in Cast Away, is that the main character (Pi, short for Piscine) is trapped in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. He's Indian and multi-religious - a true believer in Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. He comes from a family of zookeepers who were transporting their animals by freighter. This is how he wound up with a tiger in his lifeboat. It's an inspiring book, but drags in spots -- more than 200 days at sea is a lot of fish and storm stories. I kept waiting for the multi-religious theme to play a real role in the story but it did so only peripherally, so the plot seems a bit disconnected. In the end, we are offered two stories: one of murder and cannibalism and one of a journey in the lifeboat with animals. A key theme comes at the end of the book in a throwaway line: Which story do you prefer? So it is with God. It's a good read and a unique plot. ",,,,,,

i,"The author's voice was nice, but the story was just dragging it's feet like no other story I've read. I started skimming. DNF",,,,,,

i,*starts book* lol psych DNF at like 30 pages in because this has got to be one of the most boring books I've ever read,,,,,,
i,"DNF Simply put, I was bored and it took everything I had to get as far as I did. It never got better for me.",,,,,,
i,Dnf due to my own stupidity really. Read the historian and was more intrigued in that. Took me forever to finish the book and now I'm on to another one,,,,,,
i," The second chance to read, and still DNF! I just couldn't continue. I'm very huge fan of Life of Pi. But I'll stand for the movie; the book isn't interesting at all, well... a few pages only.",,,,,,

i,"DNF (x2) - I don't know what all the fuss was about with this book. I have tried to read this book twice now after falling for all the hype about it. Both times I found the beginning interesting, but once they got onto the life raft it became boring.",,,,,,
i,"DNF @ 20%. This is nothing but lectures on zoology, Hinduism and Christianity. Not that this stuff isn't interesting, but a book with a good story it does not make. The weird interjections of the guy talking about some other guy are, well, weird. Frankly, this book sounds like it wants to be mega super Important, and it's not.  The narrator reading Pi's chapters did a great job though, so props to him.",,,,,,
i,"DNF I tried to get into this but it was too slow moving. Too many details about floating in the ocean with a tiger which I quickly lost interest in. Technically the writing was good I just wasn't into the story, actually I was until I realized how long I was going to have to listen to the lost at sea part. Maybe I'll try again someday. I can see where the movie might be good.",,,,,,
i,"The Life of Pi didn't really do it for me and I have no intention of reading this any further. I just found it so boring because there was to much information about animal behaviour and religion. I am not a religious person so I did skip the paragraphs when Pi was talking about God and other Gods in religions. That's another thing, we're not talking just one religion here because Pi explores many diffeent religions so there is a lot about religion and culture within this book. The animal behavior is kind of interesting but not in the detailed form within this book. I did see the film and I found the film interesting which is why I decided to read the book in the first place but I think on this occassion I prefer the film and I'm not saying the film is amazing or anything because that bored me in parts as well. Actually my boyfriend got bored way before me and we only continued watching it because I said it might pick up. So going back to the book, I'm marking this as DNF because I'm not going to read any more of it and I need to read books i'm interested in otherwise i'm just not going to read them and I want to get to 50 books this year. There are people who will love this book but it's just not really my thing. So if it's your thing then by all means read it, it just didn't suit me.",,,,,,
i,"Dnf at Ch.70.  Could be improved if: Richard Parker eats Pi at Chapter 54. I will keep this review short, just to say that I really did not like Life of Pi. I don't feel that it deserves one star because the author's vision is grand. However, I tried to like this book. I tried so hard - and when you find yourself trying to enjoy it, yet not really doing so, you know it's just not the book for you. This was my first go at an audio-book and maybe that's why I didn't gel with the story as much. As another reviewer put it: the best enlightenment was realising that I didn't HAVE to finish this book, for all that I tried. The most interesting part was at the beginning, when Pi took the reader through his journey of discovering the different religions and practising them all at once. I think I will watch the film and probably enjoy it. Update: watched the film and loved it!",,,,,,
c,"Lots of surprises - I think I should maybe read this one again because at the end I kind of said, ""Huh?"" But any book that makes you want to turn around and read it again the minute you finish it has to be good, right?",,,,,,
c,"This book suffers in the frame narration--the beginning is especially tedious--but gains steam as the meat of the story (no pun intended) presents itself. I do appreciate, as many of the reviewers note, the consistency of tone and voice that lend the outrageous events of the plot credibility. It is the central plot that drives and redeems this book. I was disappointed by the denouement, where the author reveals rather flippantly the unreliability of the main character, Pi, and his storytelling. Leaving the reader to doubt may have been a more effective and compelling solution.",,,,,,
c,"A good survival story; a quite page-gripping work about a boy, a bengal tiger, and the vast ocean. I pretty much enjoyed reading this book although i have to admit that those sailing terms bothered me a little. The author did a good job though, picturing the emotion ride in those extreme and difficult conditions. All in all, it's a worth reading book.",,,,,,
c,"This book takes a while to get going, but once it does it's an interesting story of survival. A little gruesome/explicit for my tastes; I had to skip some of the ""Call of the Wild"" moments. Skip the author's prologue it takes away from the adventure.",,,,,,
c,dank,,,,,,
c,"not a bad book if you don't mind a weird ending with not a lot of closure. I am one of those people who like an ending to a book. A good solid ending with no questions left unanswered. Maybe thats asking a lot. Life of Pi was a slow read but not horrible, until the end. But, some people like to be left guessing. Left to kinda ponder the ""what if's"". If you are that kinda of person ... read it :)
",,,,,,
c,"Oh finally I get it. I read this a couple of years ago and it was supposed to be all about God. But no, it's not a religious allegory at all. It's about the collapse of communism. As the ocean liner of communism sinks under the weight of its own massive incompetence (a good idea, but the captain was drunk and the crew were sticky-fingered rascals), you leap overboard, clamber on to the only available boat (capitalism) only to find that there's a giant tiger on board which will eat you unless you can keep feeding it your hapless fellow-creatures. When I thought this novel was about God I gave it 2 stars. It didn't make sense. But now I realise - it's a perfect metaphor - three stars.",,,,,,
c,"As a sort of parable on the value of storytelling, Yann Martel's fantastical adventure, Life of Pi, is astonishing. In the most desperate of circumstances, while Pi is on his lifeboat with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, imagination and storytelling are the keys to Pi's incredible story of survival. Issues about believability, what really happened on the boat, take a backseat to wonder, love, creativity and to a certain extent, madness. The novel is heavy on spirituality, but it is compelling and Pi's evolving relationship with Richard Parker keeps their 227 days at sea interesting.",,,,,,
c,"man very much aware of the literary elements (obviously an avid reader and serious lit student), Yann Martel proves that a classic can certainly be construed. First off, start with a ridiculous scenario &, doing the reverse of what the Bengal tiger does in the lifeboat, fill it up with meat. He layers the inspirational tale beautifully, & it really helps that the writer's note at the beginning takes you straight to the main source. He knows tons about storytelling. This could have been a 60 page novella, but that would be lesser than the main intention: to construct a sure-fire (pre-""classic"") hit. Let me say, though, that I WAS TURNED OFF by the constant dollops of religion, perhaps what the novel's true main point is. But sometimes petitions are drags. I enjoyed the moments that transported me back to my favorite book in middle school ""The Cay"" and survival lit always does it's trick: makes you appreciate that you are where you are, and not in the middle of nowhere. Pi the boy is smart & verry patient, a detail that is perhaps even more fantastic than the premise itself. It seems cartoony at times, sure, but when the violence and gore get brutal... well, the combination is simply fantastic. Well done. (l",,,,,,
c,"A friend in Canada sent a hardback version of this book to me in 2001. I started reading it, after about 25 pages, I skipped ahead a few pages, a chapter, a bit here and there then put it down. I thought it was going to move slowly and seemed...a little too heavy post 9/11. In fall of 2003 I was leaving for a long trip through Mexico when I decided to pick up a few books to take with me. I saw the paperback and felt like the book was familiar and bought it and a couple others. I started to read this book while traveling but in the heat and the dust I was too thirsty and hot to read about a character who was thirsy and hot and stuffed it in my backpack and quickly began reading what I brought with me. I finished all of the books I brought and gave them away in exchange for novels and poetry in Spanish. I read those books, translating wiht my dictionary and asking my then partner to read to me what I could translate. We finished those too. I was about to start Don Quixote in Spanish after visiting the Don Quiote iconographic museum in Guanajuato when my partner told me if I started that one he wouldn't help me read it while we were traveling. I put it away and was left with only Yann Martel's Life of Pi. After spending the day and evening out and coming back to our room in the wee hours to make love then relax I couldn't sleep. My partner snored, a singer in the club across from our hotel in the town center was singing loudly through the night, I enjoyed listening to the people outside. I picked up Life of Pi and began. When my partner awoke I didn't want to stop but we had a full itinerary and I would get to read again until we left for the next city. As boarded our bus though, I cracked that book open and read until we arrived in the city. Fey was ill from drinking the water, while he slept I lay on the bed next to him reading outloud. I finished the book over night. I couldn't stop thinking about it. To this day, Fey still swears we saw a Senegal tiger while we were traveling, ""it must have escaped from a zoo, it was there, we fed it. Don't you remember?"" ""Of course, I do, the tiger ate you."" ""What? Oh, shut up. I know we saw it."" He wanted to check the newspapers to find out if a tiger were loose. I can't explain what exactly changed, but after a certain point in the book, the boy, the tiger - I just wanted to know them a little longer.",,,,,,

I think over 50 pages could been cut if you removed the repetitive scenes of Juliet drooling over all these jocks who happen to all really like her. The book seriously dragged. The writing was sloppy and the edition I read has a lot of typos. Overall, a messy book with an underdeveloped plot and characters. ",,,,,,
c,"Wow...this book was too much teen angst. The MC was probably the most insane character I have ever read about. First, she is obviously in a borderline abusive relationship in the beginning and she kind of admits how messed up it is. But her actions throughout the book are just overly dramatic. I mean, WAY over the top. She makes Bella Swan look normal. I skimmed through about 70% of the book. I am not sure why I didn't just give up entirely...Normally I like the young adult romances-I don't mind the overly dramatic stuff, but this book was just way too much. ",,,,,,

c,"This book tells the story of a girl named Juliet who's in a dysfunctional relationship with his boyfriend, Johnny. Johnny is possessive and protective of her (in a very unhealthy way) and they fought a lot. But still, they stuck together because they just.. fit. And then he cheated on her. I'm not sure how I feel about this one. It has some good points and bad points.  What I liked about the book is that there was no romanticization of the main characters' dysfunctional, semi-abusive relationship at all. Juliet was fully aware of the fact that her ex was a jerk and she swore him off. There's this one time where she wanted to get back with him but I'm blaming it all on her confusion and mixed feelings.  Also, I like most of the background / supporting characters. They're fun to read about! What I hated about this book is it's draggy-ness. It fucking dragged and dragged and there were a lot of unncessary dramas that would be better off. It annoyed me so much. The writing of this book also seems too messy for me -- it is all over the place at some scenes and I got really confused. Overall it's a solid 2",,,,,,

c,I took away a star because after this painfully slow tale I still didn’t find out what Johnny whispered to Dean that made him so angry. Yeah I’m petty like that!!,,,,,,
c,"I did not enjoy reading this novel as much as I hoped to - as you can tell by my rating. First of all, the actions of Johnny were a bit excessive and extreme. Juliet may have considered it sweet, but as for me, I found it to be extremely irksome. Johnny, in my opinion, was a wee bit controlling. And by that, I mean a lot. It didn't help with the fact that he felt he had little worth and constantly blamed himself for the failure of Juliet and his relationship. Although I did find his determination admirable,just not his actions. Moreover, Juliet had made her fair share of mistakes as well. My conclusion towards the middle of this novel was that the relationship was eventually going to end one way or another. It was only a matter of time. It was just incredibly vexatious that she was still swayed by Johnny and just didn't move on. But like every other love, it takes time. Johnny's brother though was an entirely different story. Albeit I am a fan of Juliet and Dean's love, it was POORLY developed. There were moments between them that led me to think, ""wait, what? How did that happen?"" Overall though, the relationship between them was a nice ending for me. I just didn't appreciate the fact that the author seemed to rush their relationship, fail to develop it and add details.",,,,,,
c,"2 stars. So where do I start? While writing this review, I am laughing my A off and not in a good way. This book is a mess from the very beginning. I avoid books with love triangle because they stress the F out of me but I decided to give this book a chance since the blurb seems intriguing. Oh well, I regret it. I just couldn't fathom how I was able to finish this book.  At first, I was rooting for Johnny because I have a soft spot for alpha type of guys and his efforts to win Juliet back were oh so sweet. And then Dean came along and I started to reconsider. Just when I started warming up to the book, crap happened. Like serious crap. The thing with Nick... oh my goodness. I wanted to DNF right then and there but I wanted to know how it will turn out in the end. But then I reached the end and the characters seem to avoid that event like the plague. I guess not all secrets get revealed. Seriously, Slow Burn is a mess, 20% good and 80% bad. Juliet and a lot of the characters acted impulsively almost all the time (not to mention under the influence of alcohol!). Towards the end, I was skipping a lot of pages because I just couldn't take it anymore. Sorry, Nicole Christie, this book is not just for me.",,,,,,
c,"WHAT THE ....ever loving crap did I just read!! This book went an entirely different direction about every 50 pages. I'm not even sure what this book was truly supposed to be about other than one girl who didn't make any sense. She was funny to read though as Nicole Christie tends to write some funny stuff.  The monkey singing shirt though....HAHAHAH...that was hilarious! Then it went from that to… I was completely at a loss. I had no idea what was going on with Dean and it blew my mind. The ending had one hell of a twist and I'm not even sure why the person wasn't my main suspect for the fires, even though they clearly were. I either A.) Didn't care or B.) lost track of the story line...as it was easy to forget what I was supposed to be following here. I wouldn't want to read this book again and it took me days to get through it because I just ",,,,,,

C'mon you are supposed to kick him. its not fully disappointed but with first book authors has established higher,,,,,,
c,"2.5 stars. This book is so drawn out its painful. I kept thinking the author could have drawn a trilogy out of this one book with the amount of things the characters go through. Gah! It wasn't bad per say just super unpolished and convoluted. I wanted the heroine to be a bit stronger and just when she started to be, she'd regress. The two love interest are interesting enough but what Dean does to her is forgiven so easily I was pissed. The author did make me laugh out loud lots and this book dealt with lots of social issues that are rampant in high school today. ",,,,,,
c,The reviews on this book were so good I was unbelievably excited to read it. However the first 75% of drivel drove me up the wall and nothing remotely exciting or romantic happens until the final 25%. The last quarter of the book was good and that earned it the two stars I hate rated it but I am disappointed that I spent two days reading this!,,,,,,
i,"Shelves: didn-t-even-finish. I do love a ""slow burn"" when it comes to relationship between the main characters, but this was just too damn slow!! There are too many characters and side stories that it gets kind of confusing of who is who. And I just didn't care.....",,,,,,

My favourite thing about this whole book that it was set in two different times, one chapter would be about Marilyn as a teenager falling in love with James and the other chapter would follow Angie, Marilyn's daughter searching for her uncle trying to get information about her dad, it was really interested - although Marilyn's chapters were my favourite to read by the end I loved Angies!! Angie wasn't my favourite character, I didn't really like how she treated Sam especially since he is obviously still in love with her and is willing to let her come to LA with him, he was super sweet. Then there was the lack of connection with Marilyn and Angie, I guess it's because they don't really interact much until the very end but?? I dunno, it was just weird, I also found it strange that Marilyn would keep such a big secret from her daughter for all those years. Overall, this was an enjoyable, quick read and although I had somereservations I still highly recommend this book! :) thank you to netgalley and the publisher for an arc",,,,,,
c,"I got sent this book in exchange for a honest review, all my opinions are my own and thank you so much to the publishers for sending me this book! Not a book for me. The book was okay and quite fast paced but I wasn't attached to the characters or the plot of the book and that really upset me cause I really wanted to love it!",,,,,,
c,"The uniqueness of an inter-generational story is one of the strengths of this book since it focuses on Angie in the present (the daughter of a white mother and black father) and the mother Marilyn. The book is Marilyn's past and the present of Angie as Angie quests to find answers about her father-- the one that her mother can't bring herself to share with Angie.  I found it drawn-out in sections especially when dealing with some of the questions that Angie had presently and the relationship with Sam, while more interested in Angie's past which was Marilyn's present-- a child actor who was her own mother's meal ticket out of a ho-hum life and the hard feelings surrounding this life. I'm torn as it has appeal, but not strong appeal for teen readers especially the length but the conversations around your parents' past and how it affects their children is powerful and worthy of discussion.",,,,,,
i,"I JUST CAN'T ANYMORE. The romantic side of the book its making me sick. I feel bad because Ava's first book is my favorite book, but this one was a painful experience, the book is not a bad one, the thing is that it has most of the things that I don't like in books.",,,,,,
c,"In Search of Us... a daughter's journey to find where she came from, and a mother's mission to protect her daughter from learning too much too soon. Marilyn, the mother, recalls the man she falls in love with. The daughter, Angie, was told her father and uncle died in a car accident before she was born. She soon discovers there is more to the story when she discovers her uncle is alive. Characters lack depth and conversations were unrealistic and dull. Disappointing.",,,,,,
c,"I felt like this book was very good right up until the end. I felt like there was so much lead up to the end and then a bomb was dropped and the book ended abruptly. I feel like there was a serious theme that emerged at the end and then the author just looked the other way. I don’t know, seemed like a Lot of fluff for nothing.",,,,,,
c,"This was emotional and heavy and so, so good.  IN SEARCH OF US follows Marilyn and Angie, mother and daughter, at seventeen years of age. And let me just say, right off the bat, that multigenerational stories are my absolute favorite. Marilyn’s story is set in the ninetees and Angie’s in modern time, and one of the many things I noticed and loved is that the time periods are described with their own unique characteristics (ie, pink panther ice cream). This is what I want from stories such as these: the opportunity to flip between one period to another and feel transported back and forth. Marilyn and Angie are truly interesting leads. They are each developer equally in strength, to a point where I honestly did not find myself favoring one POV over the other (which is rare for me!). Their voices are distinct and so are their personalities, so that even if the chapters weren’t labeled and if the text was out of context, I’d easily be able to tell which POV was which. #MasterWriterAlert Ava Dellaira’s writing is truly lovely. There were many passages I couldn’t help but take note of and mark because they’re just ... beautiful. Marilyn is a photographer, and I found Dellaira’s description of the photos and the sunsets and the beaches art in and of itself.  My only objection, though, is the irregularity of the pacing, particularly in the first third or so of the book. The timelines within timelines keep switching, giving an opportunity for background info to be shared. But this felt like an excuse to infodump. The plotlines intertwined insanely to a point where i had to flip back and make sure what part of Angie/Marilyn’s story was what. The tenses change within transitions, but that made it no easier to tell what was happening. Chapter breaks might help? But I don’t know. This was only an issue in the very beginning, though, before the convoluted plot finally straightened.  All in all? I loved loved loved this one. Yes, this is my first Ava Dellaira book, but I enjoy her style, so I’ll be checking out LOVE LETTERS TO THE DEAD, too. If you like multigenerational (!!!) stories and emotional plotlines, this one is definitely for you.  Thank you, FSG, for the ARC!",,,,,,
c,"Y’all this book had SO MUCH potential. So much and for me it flopped because of Angie. There are some issues that will always be important to address and I feel like Angie’s character dulled my senses so much the first 80% that was just read to know what happened. Now Marilyn and James, this whole book could’ve been their story with way less inner dialogue from Angie. Half of the time I found myself skimming her parts because it was very bland. I really liked the book mainly for Marilyn and James. I wanted them to win so bad. I just can’t get over how much I disliked Angie throughout the story, thus, 3 Stars. ***update*** I finally figured out how I feel about this book. It was watered down. So much potential to pack a huge punch. ",,,,,,
i,"dnf @ page 173.  I just.... how the fuck is this book so hyped??? I expected it to be a fantasy with political intrigues and complexities, and instead I got high school drama, bullies and one dumb as hell main character. No thank you.",,,,,,
i,"Mini review: DNF x2 This book has been circulating GR since end of 2017. Holly Black is a well respected fairy writer. I decided to give this a try due to the hype. As you can tell by my rating I didn’t like it. The writing was terrible. It should’ve been narrated in third person. I had no sense of world building save that it was a fairy realm. There weren’t any court systems (Autumn, Spring, and so on). And the seemingly established ‘rules’ wasn’t really present. The only thing I knew was that the fairies didn’t like humans. And that the fairies can’t lie but have ways of deception. I found Cardan and his posey were abusive. I really don’t like the idea of Jude and Cardan being end game. And jeez way too much deception and murdering for me to handle. I only liked Vivi and Oak. That’s it. Overall I really didn’t like this book. I don't recommend. ",,,,,,
c,"1.5 stars? Meh ?? Yea - unpopular opinion coming through, don't murder me pls. This was an enormous disappointment. I was bored out of my mind for the first half (3/5ths) and skim-read through the rest, looking forward to the moment I finished. - I don't like the writing. I felt like I was reading a draft rather than a final copy, and it had more the feel of a middle grade book than anything else, which I don't like. I haven't read any Holly Black before, and I dont think I will in the future either if it's all like this. - The characters were boring (maybe with the exception of Madoc) and I couldn't care less about them. I don't think they developed particularly well and they're utterly forgettable. - The story definitely had potential, and the synopsis had me so intrigued, but in the end it was so tedious and could have been many many pages shorter (or at least included some more well-written excitement). I may not have read a lot of books, but I've read some really great fantasy that had me breathing hard and clutching the pages, and this was nowhere close. Not by a mile. - The world felt... unimpressive? I don't know, but it felt like something someone would come up with at 10, what with people riding on frogs and being part animal. I dunno. - I can't really come up with anything that I liked about this? Hmm I just don't think this was for me, because whatever it is that 98% of everyone else sees and enjoys about this must have avoided me like the plague. ",,,,,,
c,Am i really supposed to believe that a 17 year old human girl is the smartest person in all of the fairy world? This book was incredibly juvenile and predictable.,,,,,,
i,"I really, really wanted to love this one. I was so excited for it to come out, and that synopsis had me hooked from the start. Unfortunately, I ran into content I just wasn’t comfortable reading. I made it about a third of the way through before calling it quits. (Which is okay–life’s too short to read books you don’t enjoy, and it’s not worth it to me to push through inappropriate content just for the sake of a review.) Why I DNF’d The Cruel Prince: 1. The fact that Jude is (minor spoiler) living with her parents’ murder, and considers him family. I’m not okay with this. 2. The lesbian/bisexual couple. Being a conservative Christian reader, I found this content unnecessary and inappropriate. 3. There was no warmth to this book. Like, at all. All of the characters were heartless people who wanted to stab/punch/maim/otherwise inflict pain on almost everyone else. I get ruthlessness, but in small doses, okay? This book lacked heart. What I really wanted from this book was to be enchanted. I wanted to be swept away to Faerieland, and dazzled by the wonderful sights and sucked in by the courtly intrigue. This book failed to do that for me, and instead I was left with a book about bullying and abuse. Oh well–I plan on vetting my TBR list much more carefully in the future. Rating: 1 star (DNF) Alternatives: An Enchantment of Ravens by Margaret Rogerson, The Tales of Goldstone Woods series by Anne Elisabeth Stengl ",,,,,,
c,"I was hoping this book would tell a story about a great Alaskan adventure. Instead it was really about an Alaskan disaster. Constant weather reports mixed with heartache, spousal/child abuse, implausible events becoming an interwoven monotonous, tedious chore to read. I really loved the Nightingale book...this doesn’t even come close. I feel like this book was written for someone in their teens. Sadly disappointing.",,,,,,
